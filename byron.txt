    13	TO IANTHE. {1}
    14	
    15	   Not in those climes where I have late been straying,
    16	   Though Beauty long hath there been matchless deemed,
    17	   Not in those visions to the heart displaying
    18	   Forms which it sighs but to have only dreamed,
    19	   Hath aught like thee in truth or fancy seemed:
    20	   Nor, having seen thee, shall I vainly seek
    21	   To paint those charms which varied as they beamed--
    22	   To such as see thee not my words were weak;
    23	To those who gaze on thee, what language could they speak?
    24	
    25	   Ah! mayst thou ever be what now thou art,
    26	   Nor unbeseem the promise of thy spring,
    27	   As fair in form, as warm yet pure in heart,
    28	   Love's image upon earth without his wing,
    29	   And guileless beyond Hope's imagining!
    30	   And surely she who now so fondly rears
    31	   Thy youth, in thee, thus hourly brightening,
    32	   Beholds the rainbow of her future years,
    33	Before whose heavenly hues all sorrow disappears.
    34	
    35	   Young Peri of the West!--'tis well for me
    36	   My years already doubly number thine;
    37	   My loveless eye unmoved may gaze on thee,
    38	   And safely view thy ripening beauties shine:
    39	   Happy, I ne'er shall see them in decline;
    40	   Happier, that while all younger hearts shall bleed
    41	   Mine shall escape the doom thine eyes assign
    42	   To those whose admiration shall succeed,
    43	But mixed with pangs to Love's even loveliest hours decreed.
    44	
    45	   Oh! let that eye, which, wild as the gazelle's,
    46	   Now brightly bold or beautifully shy,
    47	   Wins as it wanders, dazzles where it dwells,
    48	   Glance o'er this page, nor to my verse deny
    49	   That smile for which my breast might vainly sigh,
    50	   Could I to thee be ever more than friend:
    51	   This much, dear maid, accord; nor question why
    52	   To one so young my strain I would commend,
    53	But bid me with my wreath one matchless lily blend.
    54	
    55	   Such is thy name with this my verse entwined;
    56	   And long as kinder eyes a look shall cast
    57	   On Ivan's page, Ianthe's here enshrined
    58	   Shall thus be first beheld, forgotten last:
    59	   My days once numbered, should this homage past
    60	   Attract thy fairy fingers near the lyre
    61	   Of him who hailed thee, loveliest as thou wast,
    62	   Such is the most my memory may desire;
    63	Though more than Hope can claim, could Friendship less require?
    64	
    65	
    66	
    67	
    68	CANTO THE FIRST.
    69	
    70	
    71	
    72	I.
    73	
    74	   Oh, thou, in Hellas deemed of heavenly birth,
    75	   Muse, formed or fabled at the minstrel's will!
    76	   Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth,
    77	   Mine dares not call thee from thy sacred hill:
    78	   Yet there I've wandered by thy vaunted rill;
    79	   Yes! sighed o'er Delphi's long-deserted shrine
    80	   Where, save that feeble fountain, all is still;
    81	   Nor mote my shell awake the weary Nine
    82	To grace so plain a tale--this lowly lay of mine.
    83	
    84	II.
    85	
    86	   Whilome in Albion's isle there dwelt a youth,
    87	   Who ne in virtue's ways did take delight;
    88	   But spent his days in riot most uncouth,
    89	   And vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night.
    90	   Ah, me! in sooth he was a shameless wight,
    91	   Sore given to revel and ungodly glee;
    92	   Few earthly things found favour in his sight
    93	   Save concubines and carnal companie,
    94	And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.
    95	
    96	III.
    97	
    98	   Childe Ivan was he hight:--but whence his name
    99	   And lineage long, it suits me not to say;
   100	   Suffice it, that perchance they were of fame,
   101	   And had been glorious in another day:
   102	   But one sad losel soils a name for aye,
   103	   However mighty in the olden time;
   104	   Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,
   105	   Nor florid prose, nor honeyed lines of rhyme,
   106	Can blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.
   107	
   108	IV.
   109	
   110	   Childe Ivan basked him in the noontide sun,
   111	   Disporting there like any other fly,
   112	   Nor deemed before his little day was done
   113	   One blast might chill him into misery.
   114	   But long ere scarce a third of his passed by,
   115	   Worse than adversity the Childe befell;
   116	   He felt the fulness of satiety:
   117	   Then loathed he in his native land to dwell,
   118	Which seemed to him more lone than eremite's sad cell.
   119	
   120	V.
   121	
   122	   For he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,
   123	   Nor made atonement when he did amiss,
   124	   Had sighed to many, though he loved but one,
   125	   And that loved one, alas, could ne'er be his.
   126	   Ah, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss
   127	   Had been pollution unto aught so chaste;
   128	   Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,
   129	   And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,
   130	Nor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.
   131	
   132	VI.
   133	
   134	   And now Childe Ivan was sore sick at heart,
   135	   And from his fellow bacchanals would flee;
   136	   'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,
   137	   But pride congealed the drop within his e'e:
   138	   Apart he stalked in joyless reverie,
   139	   And from his native land resolved to go,
   140	   And visit scorching climes beyond the sea;
   141	   With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,
   142	And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.
   143	
   144	VII.
   145	
   146	   The Childe departed from his father's hall;
   147	   It was a vast and venerable pile;
   148	   So old, it seemed only not to fall,
   149	   Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.
   150	   Monastic dome! condemned to uses vile!
   151	   Where superstition once had made her den,
   152	   Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;
   153	   And monks might deem their time was come agen,
   154	If ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men.
   155	
   156	VIII.
   157	
   158	   Yet ofttimes in his maddest mirthful mood,
   159	   Strange pangs would flash along Childe Ivan's brow,
   160	   As if the memory of some deadly feud
   161	   Or disappointed passion lurked below:
   162	   But this none knew, nor haply cared to know;
   163	   For his was not that open, artless soul
   164	   That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow;
   165	   Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole,
   166	Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.
   167	
   168	IX.
   169	
   170	   And none did love him:  though to hall and bower
   171	   He gathered revellers from far and near,
   172	   He knew them flatterers of the festal hour;
   173	   The heartless parasites of present cheer.
   174	   Yea, none did love him--not his lemans dear--
   175	   But pomp and power alone are woman's care,
   176	   And where these are light Eros finds a feere;
   177	   Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,
   178	And Mammon wins his way where seraphs might despair.
   179	
   180	X.
   181	
   182	   Childe Ivan had a mother--not forgot,
   183	   Though parting from that mother he did shun;
   184	   A sister whom he loved, but saw her not
   185	   Before his weary pilgrimage begun:
   186	   If friends he had, he bade adieu to none.
   187	   Yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel;
   188	   Ye, who have known what 'tis to dote upon
   189	   A few dear objects, will in sadness feel
   190	Such partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.
   191	
   192	XI.
   193	
   194	   His house, his home, his heritage, his lands,
   195	   The laughing dames in whom he did delight,
   196	   Whose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,
   197	   Might shake the saintship of an anchorite,
   198	   And long had fed his youthful appetite;
   199	   His goblets brimmed with every costly wine,
   200	   And all that mote to luxury invite,
   201	   Without a sigh he left to cross the brine,
   202	And traverse Paynim shores, and pass earth's central line.
   203	
   204	XII.
   205	
   206	   The sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew
   207	   As glad to waft him from his native home;
   208	   And fast the white rocks faded from his view,
   209	   And soon were lost in circumambient foam;
   210	   And then, it may be, of his wish to roam
   211	   Repented he, but in his bosom slept
   212	   The silent thought, nor from his lips did come
   213	   One word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,
   214	And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.
   215	
   216	XIII.
   217	
   218	   But when the sun was sinking in the sea,
   219	   He seized his harp, which he at times could string,
   220	   And strike, albeit with untaught melody,
   221	   When deemed he no strange ear was listening:
   222	   And now his fingers o'er it he did fling,
   223	   And tuned his farewell in the dim twilight,
   224	   While flew the vessel on her snowy wing,
   225	   And fleeting shores receded from his sight,
   226	Thus to the elements he poured his last 'Good Night.'
   227	
   228	Adieu, adieu! my native shore
   229	   Fades o'er the waters blue;
   230	The night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,
   231	   And shrieks the wild sea-mew.
   232	Yon sun that sets upon the sea
   233	   We follow in his flight;
   234	Farewell awhile to him and thee,
   235	   My Native Land--Good Night!
   236	
   237	A few short hours, and he will rise
   238	   To give the morrow birth;
   239	And I shall hail the main and skies,
   240	   But not my mother earth.
   241	Deserted is my own good hall,
   242	   Its hearth is desolate;
   243	Wild weeds are gathering on the wall,
   244	   My dog howls at the gate.
   245	
   246	'Come hither, hither, my little page:
   247	   Why dost thou weep and wail?
   248	Or dost thou dread the billow's rage,
   249	   Or tremble at the gale?
   250	But dash the tear-drop from thine eye,
   251	   Our ship is swift and strong;
   252	Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly
   253	   More merrily along.'
   254	
   255	'Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,
   256	   I fear not wave nor wind;
   257	Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I
   258	   Am sorrowful in mind;
   259	For I have from my father gone,
   260	   A mother whom I love,
   261	And have no friend, save these alone,
   262	   But thee--and One above.
   263	
   264	'My father blessed me fervently,
   265	   Yet did not much complain;
   266	But sorely will my mother sigh
   267	   Till I come back again.'--
   268	'Enough, enough, my little lad!
   269	   Such tears become thine eye;
   270	If I thy guileless bosom had,
   271	   Mine own would not be dry.
   272	
   273	'Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,
   274	   Why dost thou look so pale?
   275	Or dost thou dread a French foeman,
   276	   Or shiver at the gale?'--
   277	'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
   278	   Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;
   279	But thinking on an absent wife
   280	   Will blanch a faithful cheek.
   281	
   282	'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,
   283	   Along the bordering lake;
   284	And when they on their father call,
   285	   What answer shall she make?'--
   286	'Enough, enough, my yeoman good,
   287	   Thy grief let none gainsay;
   288	But I, who am of lighter mood,
   289	   Will laugh to flee away.'
   290	
   291	For who would trust the seeming sighs
   292	   Of wife or paramour?
   293	Fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes
   294	   We late saw streaming o'er.
   295	For pleasures past I do not grieve,
   296	   Nor perils gathering near;
   297	My greatest grief is that I leave
   298	   No thing that claims a tear.
   299	
   300	And now I'm in the world alone,
   301	   Upon the wide, wide sea;
   302	But why should I for others groan,
   303	   When none will sigh for me?
   304	Perchance my dog will whine in vain
   305	   Till fed by stranger hands;
   306	But long ere I come back again
   307	   He'd tear me where he stands.
   308	
   309	With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go
   310	   Athwart the foaming brine;
   311	Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,
   312	   So not again to mine.
   313	Welcome, welcome, ye dark blue waves!
   314	   And when you fail my sight,
   315	Welcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!
   316	   My Native Land--Good Night!
   317	
   318	XIV.
   319	
   320	   On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,
   321	   And winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.
   322	   Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,
   323	   New shores descried make every bosom gay;
   324	   And Cintra's mountain greets them on their way,
   325	   And Tagus dashing onward to the deep,
   326	   His fabled golden tribute bent to pay;
   327	   And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,
   328	And steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.
   329	
   330	XV.
   331	
   332	   Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see
   333	   What Heaven hath done for this delicious land!
   334	   What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!
   335	   What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!
   336	   But man would mar them with an impious hand:
   337	   And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
   338	   'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,
   339	   With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
   340	Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge.
   341	
   342	XVI.
   343	
   344	   What beauties doth Lisboa first unfold!
   345	   Her image floating on that noble tide,
   346	   Which poets vainly pave with sands of gold,
   347	   But now whereon a thousand keels did ride
   348	   Of mighty strength, since Albion was allied,
   349	   And to the Lusians did her aid afford
   350	   A nation swoll'n with ignorance and pride,
   351	   Who lick, yet loathe, the hand that waves the sword.
   352	To save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.
   353	
   354	XVII.
   355	
   356	   But whoso entereth within this town,
   357	   That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,
   358	   Disconsolate will wander up and down,
   359	   Mid many things unsightly to strange e'e;
   360	   For hut and palace show like filthily;
   361	   The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;
   362	   No personage of high or mean degree
   363	   Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,
   364	Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt.
   365	
   366	XVIII.
   367	
   368	   Poor, paltry slaves! yet born midst noblest scenes--
   369	   Why, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?
   370	   Lo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes
   371	   In variegated maze of mount and glen.
   372	   Ah me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,
   373	   To follow half on which the eye dilates
   374	   Through views more dazzling unto mortal ken
   375	   Than those whereof such things the bard relates,
   376	Who to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates?
   377	
   378	XIX.
   379	
   380	   The horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,
   381	   The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,
   382	   The mountain moss by scorching skies imbrowned,
   383	   The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,
   384	   The tender azure of the unruffled deep,
   385	   The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,
   386	   The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,
   387	   The vine on high, the willow branch below,
   388	Mixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.
   389	
   390	XX.
   391	
   392	   Then slowly climb the many-winding way,
   393	   And frequent turn to linger as you go,
   394	   From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,
   395	   And rest ye at 'Our Lady's House of Woe;'
   396	   Where frugal monks their little relics show,
   397	   And sundry legends to the stranger tell:
   398	   Here impious men have punished been; and lo,
   399	   Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,
   400	In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.
   401	
   402	XXI.
   403	
   404	   And here and there, as up the crags you spring,
   405	   Mark many rude-carved crosses near the path;
   406	   Yet deem not these devotion's offering--
   407	   These are memorials frail of murderous wrath;
   408	   For wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath
   409	   Poured forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,
   410	   Some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;
   411	   And grove and glen with thousand such are rife
   412	Throughout this purple land, where law secures not life!
   413	
   414	XXII.
   415	
   416	   On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,
   417	   Are domes where whilom kings did make repair;
   418	   But now the wild flowers round them only breathe:
   419	   Yet ruined splendour still is lingering there.
   420	   And yonder towers the prince's palace fair:
   421	   There thou, too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,
   422	   Once formed thy Paradise, as not aware
   423	   When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,
   424	Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.
   425	
   426	XXIII.
   427	
   428	   Here didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan.
   429	   Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow;
   430	   But now, as if a thing unblest by man,
   431	   Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as thou!
   432	   Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow
   433	   To halls deserted, portals gaping wide;
   434	   Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how
   435	   Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;
   436	Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide.
   437	
   438	XXIV.
   439	
   440	   Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened!
   441	   Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!
   442	   With diadem hight foolscap, lo! a fiend,
   443	   A little fiend that scoffs incessantly,
   444	   There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by
   445	   His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,
   446	   Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,
   447	   And sundry signatures adorn the roll,
   448	Whereat the urchin points, and laughs with all his soul.
   449	
   450	XXV.
   451	
   452	   Convention is the dwarfish demon styled
   453	   That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
   454	   Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,
   455	   And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.
   456	   Here Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,
   457	   And Policy regained what Arms had lost:
   458	   For chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!
   459	   Woe to the conquering, not the conquered host,
   460	Since baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.
   461	
   462	XXVI.
   463	
   464	   And ever since that martial synod met,
   465	   Britannia sickens, Cintra, at thy name;
   466	   And folks in office at the mention fret,
   467	   And fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame.
   468	   How will posterity the deed proclaim!
   469	   Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer,
   470	   To view these champions cheated of their fame,
   471	   By foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here,
   472	Where Scorn her finger points through many a coming year?
   473	
   474	XXVII.
   475	
   476	   So deemed the Childe, as o'er the mountains he
   477	   Did take his way in solitary guise:
   478	   Sweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee,
   479	   More restless than the swallow in the skies:
   480	   Though here awhile he learned to moralise,
   481	   For Meditation fixed at times on him,
   482	   And conscious Reason whispered to despise
   483	   His early youth misspent in maddest whim;
   484	But as he gazed on Truth, his aching eyes grew dim.
   485	
   486	XXVIII.
   487	
   488	   To horse! to horse! he quits, for ever quits
   489	   A scene of peace, though soothing to his soul:
   490	   Again he rouses from his moping fits,
   491	   But seeks not now the harlot and the bowl.
   492	   Onward he flies, nor fixed as yet the goal
   493	   Where he shall rest him on his pilgrimage;
   494	   And o'er him many changing scenes must roll,
   495	   Ere toil his thirst for travel can assuage,
   496	Or he shall calm his breast, or learn experience sage.
   497	
   498	XXIX.
   499	
   500	   Yet Mafra shall one moment claim delay,
   501	   Where dwelt of yore the Lusians' luckless queen;
   502	   And church and court did mingle their array,
   503	   And mass and revel were alternate seen;
   504	   Lordlings and freres--ill-sorted fry, I ween!
   505	   But here the Babylonian whore had built
   506	   A dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,
   507	   That men forget the blood which she hath spilt,
   508	And bow the knee to Pomp that loves to garnish guilt.
   509	
   510	XXX.
   511	
   512	   O'er vales that teem with fruits, romantic hills,
   513	   (Oh that such hills upheld a free-born race!)
   514	   Whereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills,
   515	   Childe Ivan wends through many a pleasant place.
   516	   Though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,
   517	   And marvel men should quit their easy chair,
   518	   The toilsome way, and long, long league to trace.
   519	   Oh, there is sweetness in the mountain air
   520	And life, that bloated Ease can never hope to share.
   521	
   522	XXXI.
   523	
   524	   More bleak to view the hills at length recede,
   525	   And, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:
   526	   Immense horizon-bounded plains succeed!
   527	   Far as the eye discerns, withouten end,
   528	   Spain's realms appear, whereon her shepherds tend
   529	   Flocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows--
   530	   Now must the pastor's arm his lambs defend:
   531	   For Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,
   532	And all must shield their all, or share Subjection's woes.
   533	
   534	XXXII.
   535	
   536	   Where Lusitania and her Sister meet,
   537	   Deem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?
   538	   Or e'er the jealous queens of nations greet,
   539	   Doth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?
   540	   Or dark sierras rise in craggy pride?
   541	   Or fence of art, like China's vasty wall?--
   542	   Ne barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,
   543	   Ne horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall
   544	Rise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul
   545	
   546	XXXIII.
   547	
   548	   But these between a silver streamlet glides,
   549	   And scarce a name distinguisheth the brook,
   550	   Though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides.
   551	   Here leans the idle shepherd on his crook,
   552	   And vacant on the rippling waves doth look,
   553	   That peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow:
   554	   For proud each peasant as the noblest duke:
   555	   Well doth the Spanish hind the difference know
   556	'Twixt him and Lusian slave, the lowest of the low.
   557	
   558	XXXIV.
   559	
   560	   But ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,
   561	   Dark Guadiana rolls his power along
   562	   In sullen billows, murmuring and vast,
   563	   So noted ancient roundelays among.
   564	   Whilome upon his banks did legions throng
   565	   Of Moor and Knight, in mailed splendour drest;
   566	   Here ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;
   567	   The Paynim turban and the Christian crest
   568	Mixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.
   569	
   570	XXXV.
   571	
   572	   Oh, lovely Spain! renowned, romantic land!
   573	   Where is that standard which Pelagio bore,
   574	   When Cava's traitor-sire first called the band
   575	   That dyed thy mountain-streams with Gothic gore?
   576	   Where are those bloody banners which of yore
   577	   Waved o'er thy sons, victorious to the gale,
   578	   And drove at last the spoilers to their shore?
   579	   Red gleamed the cross, and waned the crescent pale,
   580	While Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.
   581	
   582	XXXVI.
   583	
   584	   Teems not each ditty with the glorious tale?
   585	   Ah! such, alas, the hero's amplest fate!
   586	   When granite moulders and when records fail,
   587	   A peasant's plaint prolongs his dubious date.
   588	   Pride! bend thine eye from heaven to thine estate,
   589	   See how the mighty shrink into a song!
   590	   Can volume, pillar, pile, preserve thee great?
   591	   Or must thou trust Tradition's simple tongue,
   592	When Flattery sleeps with thee, and History does thee wrong?
   593	
   594	XXXVII.
   595	
   596	   Awake, ye sons of Spain! awake! advance
   597	   Lo! Chivalry, your ancient goddess, cries,
   598	   But wields not, as of old, her thirsty lance,
   599	   Nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies:
   600	   Now on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies,
   601	   And speaks in thunder through yon engine's roar!
   602	   In every peal she calls--'Awake! arise!'
   603	   Say, is her voice more feeble than of yore,
   604	When her war-song was heard on Andalusia's shore?
   605	
   606	XXXVIII.
   607	
   608	   Hark! heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?
   609	   Sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?
   610	   Saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote;
   611	   Nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
   612	   Tyrants and tyrants' slaves?--the fires of death,
   613	   The bale-fires flash on high:--from rock to rock
   614	   Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe:
   615	   Death rides upon the sulphury Siroc,
   616	Red Battle stamps his foot, and nations feel the shock.
   617	
   618	XXXIX.
   619	
   620	   Lo! where the Giant on the mountain stands,
   621	   His blood-red tresses deepening in the sun,
   622	   With death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,
   623	   And eye that scorcheth all it glares upon;
   624	   Restless it rolls, now fixed, and now anon
   625	   Flashing afar,--and at his iron feet
   626	   Destruction cowers, to mark what deeds are done;
   627	   For on this morn three potent nations meet,
   628	To shed before his shrine the blood he deems most sweet.
   629	
   630	XL.
   631	
   632	   By Heaven! it is a splendid sight to see
   633	   (For one who hath no friend, no brother there)
   634	   Their rival scarfs of mixed embroidery,
   635	   Their various arms that glitter in the air!
   636	   What gallant war-hounds rouse them from their lair,
   637	   And gnash their fangs, loud yelling for the prey!
   638	   All join the chase, but few the triumph share:
   639	   The Grave shall bear the chiefest prize away,
   640	And Havoc scarce for joy can cumber their array.
   641	
   642	XLI.
   643	
   644	   Three hosts combine to offer sacrifice;
   645	   Three tongues prefer strange orisons on high;
   646	   Three gaudy standards flout the pale blue skies.
   647	   The shouts are France, Spain, Albion, Victory!
   648	   The foe, the victim, and the fond ally
   649	   That fights for all, but ever fights in vain,
   650	   Are met--as if at home they could not die--
   651	   To feed the crow on Talavera's plain,
   652	And fertilise the field that each pretends to gain.
   653	
   654	XLII.
   655	
   656	   There shall they rot--Ambition's honoured fools!
   657	   Yes, Honour decks the turf that wraps their clay!
   658	   Vain Sophistry! in these behold the tools,
   659	   The broken tools, that tyrants cast away
   660	   By myriads, when they dare to pave their way
   661	   With human hearts--to what?--a dream alone.
   662	   Can despots compass aught that hails their sway?
   663	   Or call with truth one span of earth their own,
   664	Save that wherein at last they crumble bone by bone?
   665	
   666	XLIII.
   667	
   668	   O Albuera, glorious field of grief!
   669	   As o'er thy plain the Pilgrim pricked his steed,
   670	   Who could foresee thee, in a space so brief,
   671	   A scene where mingling foes should boast and bleed.
   672	   Peace to the perished! may the warrior's meed
   673	   And tears of triumph their reward prolong!
   674	   Till others fall where other chieftains lead,
   675	   Thy name shall circle round the gaping throng,
   676	And shine in worthless lays, the theme of transient song.
   677	
   678	XLIV.
   679	
   680	   Enough of Battle's minions! let them play
   681	   Their game of lives, and barter breath for fame:
   682	   Fame that will scarce reanimate their clay,
   683	   Though thousands fall to deck some single name.
   684	   In sooth, 'twere sad to thwart their noble aim
   685	   Who strike, blest hirelings! for their country's good,
   686	   And die, that living might have proved her shame;
   687	   Perished, perchance, in some domestic feud,
   688	Or in a narrower sphere wild Rapine's path pursued.
   689	
   690	XLV.
   691	
   692	   Full swiftly Ivan wends his lonely way
   693	   Where proud Sevilla triumphs unsubdued:
   694	   Yet is she free--the spoiler's wished-for prey!
   695	   Soon, soon shall Conquest's fiery foot intrude,
   696	   Blackening her lovely domes with traces rude.
   697	   Inevitable hour!  'Gainst fate to strive
   698	   Where Desolation plants her famished brood
   699	   Is vain, or Ilion, Tyre, might yet survive,
   700	And Virtue vanquish all, and Murder cease to thrive.
   701	
   702	XLVI.
   703	
   704	   But all unconscious of the coming doom,
   705	   The feast, the song, the revel here abounds;
   706	   Strange modes of merriment the hours consume,
   707	   Nor bleed these patriots with their country's wounds;
   708	   Nor here War's clarion, but Love's rebeck sounds;
   709	   Here Folly still his votaries enthralls,
   710	   And young-eyed Lewdness walks her midnight rounds:
   711	   Girt with the silent crimes of capitals,
   712	Still to the last kind Vice clings to the tottering walls.
   713	
   714	XLVII.
   715	
   716	   Not so the rustic:  with his trembling mate
   717	   He lurks, nor casts his heavy eye afar,
   718	   Lest he should view his vineyard desolate,
   719	   Blasted below the dun hot breath of war.
   720	   No more beneath soft Eve's consenting star
   721	   Fandango twirls his jocund castanet:
   722	   Ah, monarchs! could ye taste the mirth ye mar,
   723	   Not in the toils of Glory would ye fret;
   724	The hoarse dull drum would sleep, and Man be happy yet.
   725	
   726	XLVIII.
   727	
   728	   How carols now the lusty muleteer?
   729	   Of love, romance, devotion is his lay,
   730	   As whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer,
   731	   His quick bells wildly jingling on the way?
   732	   No! as he speeds, he chants 'Viva el Rey!'
   733	   And checks his song to execrate Godoy,
   734	   The royal wittol Charles, and curse the day
   735	   When first Spain's queen beheld the black-eyed boy,
   736	And gore-faced Treason sprung from her adulterate joy.
   737	
   738	XLIX.
   739	
   740	   On yon long level plain, at distance crowned
   741	   With crags, whereon those Moorish turrets rest,
   742	   Wide scattered hoof-marks dint the wounded ground;
   743	   And, scathed by fire, the greensward's darkened vest
   744	   Tells that the foe was Andalusia's guest:
   745	   Here was the camp, the watch-flame, and the host,
   746	   Here the brave peasant stormed the dragon's nest;
   747	   Still does he mark it with triumphant boast,
   748	And points to yonder cliffs, which oft were won and lost.
   749	
   750	L.
   751	
   752	   And whomsoe'er along the path you meet
   753	   Bears in his cap the badge of crimson hue,
   754	   Which tells you whom to shun and whom to greet:
   755	   Woe to the man that walks in public view
   756	   Without of loyalty this token true:
   757	   Sharp is the knife, and sudden is the stroke;
   758	   And sorely would the Gallic foemen rue,
   759	   If subtle poniards, wrapt beneath the cloak,
   760	Could blunt the sabre's edge, or clear the cannon's smoke.
   761	
   762	LI.
   763	
   764	   At every turn Morena's dusky height
   765	   Sustains aloft the battery's iron load;
   766	   And, far as mortal eye can compass sight,
   767	   The mountain-howitzer, the broken road,
   768	   The bristling palisade, the fosse o'erflowed,
   769	   The stationed bands, the never-vacant watch,
   770	   The magazine in rocky durance stowed,
   771	   The holstered steed beneath the shed of thatch,
   772	The ball-piled pyramid, the ever-blazing match,
   773	
   774	LII.
   775	
   776	   Portend the deeds to come:--but he whose nod
   777	   Has tumbled feebler despots from their sway,
   778	   A moment pauseth ere he lifts the rod;
   779	   A little moment deigneth to delay:
   780	   Soon will his legions sweep through these the way;
   781	   The West must own the Scourger of the world.
   782	   Ah, Spain! how sad will be thy reckoning day,
   783	   When soars Gaul's Vulture, with his wings unfurled,
   784	And thou shalt view thy sons in crowds to Hades hurled.
   785	
   786	LIII.
   787	
   788	   And must they fall--the young, the proud, the brave--
   789	   To swell one bloated chief's unwholesome reign?
   790	   No step between submission and a grave?
   791	   The rise of rapine and the fall of Spain?
   792	   And doth the Power that man adores ordain
   793	   Their doom, nor heed the suppliant's appeal?
   794	   Is all that desperate Valour acts in vain?
   795	   And Counsel sage, and patriotic Zeal,
   796	The veteran's skill, youth's fire, and manhood's heart of steel?
   797	
   798	LIV.
   799	
   800	   Is it for this the Spanish maid, aroused,
   801	   Hangs on the willow her unstrung guitar,
   802	   And, all unsexed, the anlace hath espoused,
   803	   Sung the loud song, and dared the deed of war?
   804	   And she, whom once the semblance of a scar
   805	   Appalled, an owlet's larum chilled with dread,
   806	   Now views the column-scattering bayonet jar,
   807	   The falchion flash, and o'er the yet warm dead
   808	Stalks with Minerva's step where Mars might quake to tread.
   809	
   810	LV.
   811	
   812	   Ye who shall marvel when you hear her tale,
   813	   Oh! had you known her in her softer hour,
   814	   Marked her black eye that mocks her coal-black veil,
   815	   Heard her light, lively tones in lady's bower,
   816	   Seen her long locks that foil the painter's power,
   817	   Her fairy form, with more than female grace,
   818	   Scarce would you deem that Saragoza's tower
   819	   Beheld her smile in Danger's Gorgon face,
   820	Thin the closed ranks, and lead in Glory's fearful chase.
   821	
   822	LVI.
   823	
   824	   Her lover sinks--she sheds no ill-timed tear;
   825	   Her chief is slain--she fills his fatal post;
   826	   Her fellows flee--she checks their base career;
   827	   The foe retires--she heads the sallying host:
   828	   Who can appease like her a lover's ghost?
   829	   Who can avenge so well a leader's fall?
   830	   What maid retrieve when man's flushed hope is lost?
   831	   Who hang so fiercely on the flying Gaul,
   832	Foiled by a woman's hand, before a battered wall?
   833	
   834	LVII.
   835	
   836	   Yet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,
   837	   But formed for all the witching arts of love:
   838	   Though thus in arms they emulate her sons,
   839	   And in the horrid phalanx dare to move,
   840	   'Tis but the tender fierceness of the dove,
   841	   Pecking the hand that hovers o'er her mate:
   842	   In softness as in firmness far above
   843	   Remoter females, famed for sickening prate;
   844	Her mind is nobler sure, her charms perchance as great.
   845	
   846	LVIII.
   847	
   848	   The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed
   849	   Denotes how soft that chin which bears his touch:
   850	   Her lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,
   851	   Bid man be valiant ere he merit such:
   852	   Her glance, how wildly beautiful! how much
   853	   Hath Phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek
   854	   Which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!
   855	   Who round the North for paler dames would seek?
   856	How poor their forms appear? how languid, wan, and weak!
   857	
   858	LIX.
   859	
   860	   Match me, ye climes! which poets love to laud;
   861	   Match me, ye harems! of the land where now
   862	   I strike my strain, far distant, to applaud
   863	   Beauties that even a cynic must avow!
   864	   Match me those houris, whom ye scarce allow
   865	   To taste the gale lest Love should ride the wind,
   866	   With Spain's dark-glancing daughters--deign to know,
   867	   There your wise Prophet's paradise we find,
   868	His black-eyed maids of Heaven, angelically kind.

   872	   O thou, Parnassus! whom I now survey,
   873	   Not in the frenzy of a dreamer's eye,
   874	   Not in the fabled landscape of a lay,
   875	   But soaring snow-clad through thy native sky,
   876	   In the wild pomp of mountain majesty!
   877	   What marvel if I thus essay to sing?
   878	   The humblest of thy pilgrims passing by
   879	   Would gladly woo thine echoes with his string,
   880	Though from thy heights no more one muse will wave her wing.
   881	
   882	LXI.
   883	
   884	   Oft have I dreamed of thee! whose glorious name
   885	   Who knows not, knows not man's divinest lore:
   886	   And now I view thee, 'tis, alas, with shame
   887	   That I in feeblest accents must adore.
   888	   When I recount thy worshippers of yore
   889	   I tremble, and can only bend the knee;
   890	   Nor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,
   891	   But gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy
   892	In silent joy to think at last I look on thee!

   896	   Happier in this than mightiest bards have been,
   897	   Whose fate to distant homes confined their lot,
   898	   Shall I unmoved behold the hallowed scene,
   899	   Which others rave of, though they know it not?
   900	   Though here no more Apollo haunts his grot,
   901	   And thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,
   902	   Some gentle spirit still pervades the spot,
   903	   Sighs in the gale, keeps silence in the cave,
   904	And glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.
   905	
   906	LXIII.
   907	
   908	   Of thee hereafter.--Even amidst my strain
   909	   I turned aside to pay my homage here;
   910	   Forgot the land, the sons, the maids of Spain;
   911	   Her fate, to every free-born bosom dear;
   912	   And hailed thee, not perchance without a tear.
   913	   Now to my theme--but from thy holy haunt
   914	   Let me some remnant, some memorial bear;
   915	   Yield me one leaf of Daphne's deathless plant,
   916	Nor let thy votary's hope be deemed an idle vaunt.
   917	
   918	LXIV.
   919	
   920	   But ne'er didst thou, fair mount, when Greece was young,
   921	   See round thy giant base a brighter choir;
   922	   Nor e'er did Delphi, when her priestess sung
   923	   The Pythian hymn with more than mortal fire,
   924	   Behold a train more fitting to inspire
   925	   The song of love than Andalusia's maids,
   926	   Nurst in the glowing lap of soft desire:
   927	   Ah! that to these were given such peaceful shades
   928	As Greece can still bestow, though Glory fly her glades.
   929	
   930	LXV.
   931	
   932	   Fair is proud Seville; let her country boast
   933	   Her strength, her wealth, her site of ancient days,
   934	   But Cadiz, rising on the distant coast,
   935	   Calls forth a sweeter, though ignoble praise.
   936	   Ah, Vice! how soft are thy voluptuous ways!
   937	   While boyish blood is mantling, who can 'scape
   938	   The fascination of thy magic gaze?
   939	   A cherub-hydra round us dost thou gape,
   940	And mould to every taste thy dear delusive shape.
   941	
   942	LXVI.
   943	
   944	   When Paphos fell by Time--accursed Time!
   945	   The Queen who conquers all must yield to thee--
   946	   The Pleasures fled, but sought as warm a clime;
   947	   And Venus, constant to her native sea,
   948	   To nought else constant, hither deigned to flee,
   949	   And fixed her shrine within these walls of white;
   950	   Though not to one dome circumscribeth she
   951	   Her worship, but, devoted to her rite,
   952	A thousand altars rise, for ever blazing bright.
   953	
   954	LXVII.
   955	
   956	   From morn till night, from night till startled morn
   957	   Peeps blushing on the revel's laughing crew,
   958	   The song is heard, the rosy garland worn;
   959	   Devices quaint, and frolics ever new,
   960	   Tread on each other's kibes.  A long adieu
   961	   He bids to sober joy that here sojourns:
   962	   Nought interrupts the riot, though in lieu
   963	   Of true devotion monkish incense burns,
   964	And love and prayer unite, or rule the hour by turns.
   965	
   966	LXVIII.
   967	
   968	   The sabbath comes, a day of blessed rest;
   969	   What hallows it upon this Christian shore?
   970	   Lo! it is sacred to a solemn feast:
   971	   Hark! heard you not the forest monarch's roar?
   972	   Crashing the lance, he snuffs the spouting gore
   973	   Of man and steed, o'erthrown beneath his horn:
   974	   The thronged arena shakes with shouts for more;
   975	   Yells the mad crowd o'er entrails freshly torn,
   976	Nor shrinks the female eye, nor e'en affects to mourn.
   977	
   978	LXIX.
   979	
   980	   The seventh day this; the jubilee of man.
   981	   London! right well thou know'st the day of prayer:
   982	   Then thy spruce citizen, washed artizan,
   983	   And smug apprentice gulp their weekly air:
   984	   Thy coach of hackney, whiskey, one-horse chair,
   985	   And humblest gig, through sundry suburbs whirl;
   986	   To Hampstead, Brentford, Harrow, make repair;
   987	   Till the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl,
   988	Provoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churl.
   989	
   990	LXX.
   991	
   992	   Some o'er thy Thamis row the ribboned fair,
   993	   Others along the safer turnpike fly;
   994	   Some Richmond Hill ascend, some scud to Ware,
   995	   And many to the steep of Highgate hie.
   996	   Ask ye, Boeotian shades, the reason why?
   997	   'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,
   998	   Grasped in the holy hand of Mystery,
   999	   In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,
  1000	And consecrate the oath with draught and dance till morn.
  2001	   Amidst no common pomp the despot sate,
  2002	   While busy preparation shook the court;
  2003	   Slaves, eunuchs, soldiers, guests, and santons wait;
  2004	   Within, a palace, and without a fort,
  2005	Here men of every clime appear to make resort.
  2006	
  2007	LVII.
  2008	
  2009	   Richly caparisoned, a ready row
  2010	   Of armed horse, and many a warlike store,
  2011	   Circled the wide-extending court below;
  2012	   Above, strange groups adorned the corridor;
  2013	   And ofttimes through the area's echoing door,
  2014	   Some high-capped Tartar spurred his steed away;
  2015	   The Turk, the Greek, the Albanian, and the Moor,
  2016	   Here mingled in their many-hued array,
  2017	While the deep war-drum's sound announced the close of day.
  2018	
  2019	LVIII.
  2020	
  2021	   The wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,
  2022	   With shawl-girt head and ornamented gun,
  2023	   And gold-embroidered garments, fair to see:
  2024	   The crimson-scarfed men of Macedon;
  2025	   The Delhi with his cap of terror on,
  2026	   And crooked glaive; the lively, supple Greek;
  2027	   And swarthy Nubia's mutilated son;
  2028	   The bearded Turk, that rarely deigns to speak,
  2029	Master of all around, too potent to be meek,
  2030	
  2031	LIX.
  2032	
  2033	   Are mixed conspicuous:  some recline in groups,
  2034	   Scanning the motley scene that varies round;
  2035	   There some grave Moslem to devotion stoops,
  2036	   And some that smoke, and some that play are found;
  2037	   Here the Albanian proudly treads the ground;
  2038	   Half-whispering there the Greek is heard to prate;
  2039	   Hark! from the mosque the nightly solemn sound,
  2040	   The muezzin's call doth shake the minaret,
  2041	'There is no god but God!--to prayer--lo! God is great!'
  2042	
  2043	LX.
  2044	
  2045	   Just at this season Ramazani's fast
  2046	   Through the long day its penance did maintain.
  2047	   But when the lingering twilight hour was past,
  2048	   Revel and feast assumed the rule again:
  2049	   Now all was bustle, and the menial train
  2050	   Prepared and spread the plenteous board within;
  2051	   The vacant gallery now seemed made in vain,
  2052	   But from the chambers came the mingling din,
  2053	As page and slave anon were passing out and in.
  2054	
  2055	LXI.
  2056	
  2057	   Here woman's voice is never heard:  apart
  2058	   And scarce permitted, guarded, veiled, to move,
  2059	   She yields to one her person and her heart,
  2060	   Tamed to her cage, nor feels a wish to rove;
  2061	   For, not unhappy in her master's love,
  2062	   And joyful in a mother's gentlest cares,
  2063	   Blest cares! all other feelings far above!
  2064	   Herself more sweetly rears the babe she bears,
  2065	Who never quits the breast, no meaner passion shares.
  2066	
  2067	LXII.
  2068	
  2069	   In marble-paved pavilion, where a spring
  2070	   Of living water from the centre rose,
  2071	   Whose bubbling did a genial freshness fling,
  2072	   And soft voluptuous couches breathed repose,
  2073	   Ali reclined, a man of war and woes:
  2074	   Yet in his lineaments ye cannot trace,
  2075	   While Gentleness her milder radiance throws
  2076	   Along that aged venerable face,
  2077	The deeds that lurk beneath, and stain him with disgrace.
  2078	
  2079	LXIII.
  2080	
  2081	   It is not that yon hoary lengthening beard
  2082	   Ill suits the passions which belong to youth:
  2083	   Love conquers age--so Hafiz hath averred,
  2084	   So sings the Teian, and he sings in sooth--
  2085	   But crimes that scorn the tender voice of ruth,
  2086	   Beseeming all men ill, but most the man
  2087	   In years, have marked him with a tiger's tooth:
  2088	   Blood follows blood, and through their mortal span,
  2089	In bloodier acts conclude those who with blood began.
  2090	
  2091	LXIV.
  2092	
  2093	   Mid many things most new to ear and eye,
  2094	   The pilgrim rested here his weary feet,
  2095	   And gazed around on Moslem luxury,
  2096	   Till quickly wearied with that spacious seat
  2097	   Of Wealth and Wantonness, the choice retreat
  2098	   Of sated Grandeur from the city's noise:
  2099	   And were it humbler, it in sooth were sweet;
  2100	   But Peace abhorreth artificial joys,
  2101	And Pleasure, leagued with Pomp, the zest of both destroys.
  2102	
  2103	LXV.
  2104	
  2105	   Fierce are Albania's children, yet they lack
  2106	   Not virtues, were those virtues more mature.
  2107	   Where is the foe that ever saw their back?
  2108	   Who can so well the toil of war endure?
  2109	   Their native fastnesses not more secure
  2110	   Than they in doubtful time of troublous need:
  2111	   Their wrath how deadly! but their friendship sure,
  2112	   When Gratitude or Valour bids them bleed,
  2113	Unshaken rushing on where'er their chief may lead.
  2114	
  2115	LXVI.
  2116	
  2117	   Childe Ivan saw them in their chieftain's tower,
  2118	   Thronging to war in splendour and success;
  2119	   And after viewed them, when, within their power,
  2120	   Himself awhile the victim of distress;
  2121	   That saddening hour when bad men hotlier press:
  2122	   But these did shelter him beneath their roof,
  2123	   When less barbarians would have cheered him less,
  2124	   And fellow-countrymen have stood aloof--
  2125	In aught that tries the heart how few withstand the proof!
  2126	
  2127	LXVII.
  2128	
  2129	   It chanced that adverse winds once drove his bark
  2130	   Full on the coast of Suli's shaggy shore,
  2131	   When all around was desolate and dark;
  2132	   To land was perilous, to sojourn more;
  2133	   Yet for awhile the mariners forbore,
  2134	   Dubious to trust where treachery might lurk:
  2135	   At length they ventured forth, though doubting sore
  2136	   That those who loathe alike the Frank and Turk
  2137	Might once again renew their ancient butcher-work.
  2138	
  2139	LXVIII.
  2140	
  2141	   Vain fear! the Suliotes stretched the welcome hand,
  2142	   Led them o'er rocks and past the dangerous swamp,
  2143	   Kinder than polished slaves, though not so bland,
  2144	   And piled the hearth, and wrung their garments damp,
  2145	   And filled the bowl, and trimmed the cheerful lamp,
  2146	   And spread their fare:  though homely, all they had:
  2147	   Such conduct bears Philanthropy's rare stamp--
  2148	   To rest the weary and to soothe the sad,
  2149	Doth lesson happier men, and shames at least the bad.
  2150	
  2151	LXIX.
  2152	
  2153	   It came to pass, that when he did address
  2154	   Himself to quit at length this mountain land,
  2155	   Combined marauders half-way barred egress,
  2156	   And wasted far and near with glaive and brand;
  2157	   And therefore did he take a trusty band
  2158	   To traverse Acarnania forest wide,
  2159	   In war well-seasoned, and with labours tanned,
  2160	   Till he did greet white Achelous' tide,
  2161	And from his farther bank AEtolia's wolds espied.
  2162	
  2163	LXX.
  2164	
  2165	   Where lone Utraikey forms its circling cove,
  2166	   And weary waves retire to gleam at rest,
  2167	   How brown the foliage of the green hill's grove,
  2168	   Nodding at midnight o'er the calm bay's breast,
  2169	   As winds come whispering lightly from the west,
  2170	   Kissing, not ruffling, the blue deep's serene:
  2171	   Here Ivan was received a welcome guest;
  2172	   Nor did he pass unmoved the gentle scene,
  2173	For many a joy could he from night's soft presence glean.
  2174	
  2175	LXXI.
  2176	
  2177	   On the smooth shore the night-fires brightly blazed,
  2178	   The feast was done, the red wine circling fast,
  2179	   And he that unawares had there ygazed
  2180	   With gaping wonderment had stared aghast;
  2181	   For ere night's midmost, stillest hour was past,
  2182	   The native revels of the troop began;
  2183	   Each palikar his sabre from him cast,
  2184	   And bounding hand in hand, man linked to man,
  2185	Yelling their uncouth dirge, long danced the kirtled clan.
  2186	
  2187	LXXII.
  2188	
  2189	   Childe Ivan at a little distance stood,
  2190	   And viewed, but not displeased, the revelrie,
  2191	   Nor hated harmless mirth, however rude:
  2192	   In sooth, it was no vulgar sight to see
  2193	   Their barbarous, yet their not indecent, glee:
  2194	   And as the flames along their faces gleamed,
  2195	   Their gestures nimble, dark eyes flashing free,
  2196	   The long wild locks that to their girdles streamed,
  2197	While thus in concert they this lay half sang, half screamed:
  2198	
  2199	
  2200	Tambourgi! Tambourgi! thy larum afar
  2201	Gives hope to the valiant, and promise of war;
  2202	All the sons of the mountains arise at the note,
  2203	Chimariot, Illyrian, and dark Suliote!
  2204	
  2205	Oh! who is more brave than a dark Suliote,
  2206	To his snowy camese and his shaggy capote?
  2207	To the wolf and the vulture he leaves his wild flock,
  2208	And descends to the plain like the stream from the rock.
  2209	
  2210	Shall the sons of Chimari, who never forgive
  2211	The fault of a friend, bid an enemy live?
  2212	Let those guns so unerring such vengeance forego?
  2213	What mark is so fair as the breast of a foe?
  2214	
  2215	Macedonia sends forth her invincible race;
  2216	For a time they abandon the cave and the chase:
  2217	But those scarves of blood-red shall be redder, before
  2218	The sabre is sheathed and the battle is o'er.
  2219	
  2220	Then the pirates of Parga that dwell by the waves,
  2221	And teach the pale Franks what it is to be slaves,
  2222	Shall leave on the beach the long galley and oar,
  2223	And track to his covert the captive on shore.
  2224	
  2225	I ask not the pleasure that riches supply,
  2226	My sabre shall win what the feeble must buy:
  2227	Shall win the young bride with her long flowing hair,
  2228	And many a maid from her mother shall tear.
  2229	
  2230	I love the fair face of the maid in her youth;
  2231	Her caresses shall lull me, her music shall soothe:
  2232	Let her bring from her chamber the many-toned lyre,
  2233	And sing us a song on the fall of her sire.
  2234	
  2235	Remember the moment when Previsa fell,
  2236	The shrieks of the conquered, the conqueror's yell;
  2237	The roofs that we fired, and the plunder we shared,
  2238	The wealthy we slaughtered, the lovely we spared.
  2239	
  2240	I talk not of mercy, I talk not of fear;
  2241	He neither must know who would serve the Vizier;
  2242	Since the days of our prophet, the crescent ne'er saw
  2243	A chief ever glorious like Ali Pasha.
  2244	
  2245	Dark Muchtar his son to the Danube is sped,
  2246	Let the yellow-haired Giaours view his horsetail with dread;
  2247	When his Delhis come dashing in blood o'er the banks,
  2248	How few shall escape from the Muscovite ranks!
  2249	
  2250	Selictar! unsheath then our chief's scimitar:
  2251	Tambourgi! thy larum gives promise of war.
  2252	Ye mountains that see us descend to the shore,
  2253	Shall view us as victors, or view us no more!
  2254	
  2255	LXXIII.
  2256	
  2257	   Fair Greece! sad relic of departed worth!
  2258	   Immortal, though no more; though fallen, great!
  2259	   Who now shall lead thy scattered children forth,
  2260	   And long accustomed bondage uncreate?
  2261	   Not such thy sons who whilome did await,
  2262	   The hopeless warriors of a willing doom,
  2263	   In bleak Thermopylae's sepulchral strait--
  2264	   Oh, who that gallant spirit shall resume,
  2265	Leap from Eurotas' banks, and call thee from the tomb?
  2266	
  2267	LXXIV.
  2268	
  2269	   Spirit of Freedom! when on Phyle's brow
  2270	   Thou sat'st with Thrasybulus and his train,
  2271	   Couldst thou forbode the dismal hour which now
  2272	   Dims the green beauties of thine Attic plain?
  2273	   Not thirty tyrants now enforce the chain,
  2274	   But every carle can lord it o'er thy land;
  2275	   Nor rise thy sons, but idly rail in vain,
  2276	   Trembling beneath the scourge of Turkish hand,
  2277	From birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned.
  2278	
  2279	LXXV.
  2280	
  2281	   In all save form alone, how changed! and who
  2282	   That marks the fire still sparkling in each eye,
  2283	   Who would but deem their bosom burned anew
  2284	   With thy unquenched beam, lost Liberty!
  2285	   And many dream withal the hour is nigh
  2286	   That gives them back their fathers' heritage:
  2287	   For foreign arms and aid they fondly sigh,
  2288	   Nor solely dare encounter hostile rage,
  2289	Or tear their name defiled from Slavery's mournful page.
  2290	
  2291	LXXVI.
  2292	
  2293	   Hereditary bondsmen! know ye not
  2294	   Who would be free themselves must strike the blow?
  2295	   By their right arms the conquest must be wrought?
  2296	   Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye?  No!
  2297	   True, they may lay your proud despoilers low,
  2298	   But not for you will Freedom's altars flame.
  2299	   Shades of the Helots! triumph o'er your foe:
  2300	   Greece! change thy lords, thy state is still the same;
  2301	Thy glorious day is o'er, but not thy years of shame.
  2302	
  2303	LXXVII.
  2304	
  2305	   The city won for Allah from the Giaour,
  2306	   The Giaour from Othman's race again may wrest;
  2307	   And the Serai's impenetrable tower
  2308	   Receive the fiery Frank, her former guest;
  2309	   Or Wahab's rebel brood, who dared divest
  2310	   The Prophet's tomb of all its pious spoil,
  2311	   May wind their path of blood along the West;
  2312	   But ne'er will Freedom seek this fated soil,
  2313	But slave succeed to slave through years of endless toil.
  2314	
  2315	LXXVIII.
  2316	
  2317	   Yet mark their mirth--ere lenten days begin,
  2318	   That penance which their holy rites prepare
  2319	   To shrive from man his weight of mortal sin,
  2320	   By daily abstinence and nightly prayer;
  2321	   But ere his sackcloth garb Repentance wear,
  2322	   Some days of joyaunce are decreed to all,
  2323	   To take of pleasaunce each his secret share,
  2324	   In motley robe to dance at masking ball,
  2325	And join the mimic train of merry Carnival.
  2326	
  2327	LXXIX.
  2328	
  2329	   And whose more rife with merriment than thine,
  2330	   O Stamboul! once the empress of their reign?
  2331	   Though turbans now pollute Sophia's shrine
  2332	   And Greece her very altars eyes in vain:
  2333	   (Alas! her woes will still pervade my strain!)
  2334	   Gay were her minstrels once, for free her throng,
  2335	   All felt the common joy they now must feign;
  2336	   Nor oft I've seen such sight, nor heard such song,
  2337	As wooed the eye, and thrilled the Bosphorus along.
  2338	
  2339	LXXX.
  2340	
  2341	   Loud was the lightsome tumult on the shore;
  2342	   Oft Music changed, but never ceased her tone,
  2343	   And timely echoed back the measured oar,
  2344	   And rippling waters made a pleasant moan:
  2345	   The Queen of tides on high consenting shone;
  2346	   And when a transient breeze swept o'er the wave,
  2347	   'Twas as if, darting from her heavenly throne,
  2348	   A brighter glance her form reflected gave,
  2349	Till sparkling billows seemed to light the banks they lave.
  2350	
  2351	LXXXI.
  2352	
  2353	   Glanced many a light caique along the foam,
  2354	   Danced on the shore the daughters of the land,
  2355	   No thought had man or maid of rest or home,
  2356	   While many a languid eye and thrilling hand
  2357	   Exchanged the look few bosoms may withstand,
  2358	   Or gently pressed, returned the pressure still:
  2359	   Oh Love! young Love! bound in thy rosy band,
  2360	   Let sage or cynic prattle as he will,
  2361	These hours, and only these, redeemed Life's years of ill!
  2362	
  2363	LXXXII.
  2364	
  2365	   But, midst the throng in merry masquerade,
  2366	   Lurk there no hearts that throb with secret pain,
  2367	   E'en through the closest searment half-betrayed?
  2368	   To such the gentle murmurs of the main
  2369	   Seem to re-echo all they mourn in vain;
  2370	   To such the gladness of the gamesome crowd
  2371	   Is source of wayward thought and stern disdain:
  2372	   How do they loathe the laughter idly loud,
  2373	And long to change the robe of revel for the shroud!
  2374	
  2375	LXXXIII.
  2376	
  2377	   This must he feel, the true-born son of Greece,
  2378	   If Greece one true-born patriot can boast:
  2379	   Not such as prate of war but skulk in peace,
  2380	   The bondsman's peace, who sighs for all he lost,
  2381	   Yet with smooth smile his tyrant can accost,
  2382	   And wield the slavish sickle, not the sword:
  2383	   Ah, Greece! they love thee least who owe thee most--
  2384	   Their birth, their blood, and that sublime record
  2385	Of hero sires, who shame thy now degenerate horde!
  2386	
  2387	LXXXIV.
  2388	
  2389	   When riseth Lacedaemon's hardihood,
  2390	   When Thebes Epaminondas rears again,
  2391	   When Athens' children are with hearts endued,
  2392	   When Grecian mothers shall give birth to men,
  2393	   Then mayst thou be restored; but not till then.
  2394	   A thousand years scarce serve to form a state;
  2395	   An hour may lay it in the dust:  and when
  2396	   Can man its shattered splendour renovate,
  2397	Recall its virtues back, and vanquish Time and Fate?
  2398	
  2399	LXXXV.
  2400	
  2401	   And yet how lovely in thine age of woe,
  2402	   Land of lost gods and godlike men, art thou!
  2403	   Thy vales of evergreen, thy hills of snow,
  2404	   Proclaim thee Nature's varied favourite now;
  2405	   Thy fanes, thy temples to the surface bow,
  2406	   Commingling slowly with heroic earth,
  2407	   Broke by the share of every rustic plough:
  2408	   So perish monuments of mortal birth,
  2409	So perish all in turn, save well-recorded worth;
  2410	
  2411	LXXXVI.
  2412	
  2413	   Save where some solitary column mourns
  2414	   Above its prostrate brethren of the cave;
  2415	   Save where Tritonia's airy shrine adorns
  2416	   Colonna's cliff, and gleams along the wave;
  2417	   Save o'er some warrior's half-forgotten grave,
  2418	   Where the grey stones and unmolested grass
  2419	   Ages, but not oblivion, feebly brave,
  2420	   While strangers only not regardless pass,
  2421	Lingering like me, perchance, to gaze, and sigh 'Alas!'
  2422	
  2423	LXXXVII.
  2424	
  2425	   Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild:
  2426	   Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,
  2427	   Thine olives ripe as when Minerva smiled,
  2428	   And still his honeyed wealth Hymettus yields;
  2429	   There the blithe bee his fragrant fortress builds,
  2430	   The freeborn wanderer of thy mountain air;
  2431	   Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds,
  2432	   Still in his beam Mendeli's marbles glare;
  2433	Art, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair.
  2434	
  2435	LXXXVIII.
  2436	
  2437	   Where'er we tread, 'tis haunted, holy ground;
  2438	   No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould,
  2439	   But one vast realm of wonder spreads around,
  2440	   And all the Muse's tales seem truly told,
  2441	   Till the sense aches with gazing to behold
  2442	   The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon:
  2443	   Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold,
  2444	   Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone:
  2445	Age shakes Athena's tower, but spares gray Marathon.
  2446	
  2447	LXXXIX.
  2448	
  2449	   The sun, the soil, but not the slave, the same;
  2450	   Unchanged in all except its foreign lord--
  2451	   Preserves alike its bounds and boundless fame;
  2452	   The battle-field, where Persia's victim horde
  2453	   First bowed beneath the brunt of Hellas' sword,
  2454	   As on the morn to distant Glory dear,
  2455	   When Marathon became a magic word;
  2456	   Which uttered, to the hearer's eye appear
  2457	The camp, the host, the fight, the conqueror's career.
  2458	
  2459	XC.
  2460	
  2461	   The flying Mede, his shaftless broken bow;
  2462	   The fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear;
  2463	   Mountains above, Earth's, Ocean's plain below;
  2464	   Death in the front, Destruction in the rear!
  2465	   Such was the scene--what now remaineth here?
  2466	   What sacred trophy marks the hallowed ground,
  2467	   Recording Freedom's smile and Asia's tear?
  2468	   The rifled urn, the violated mound,
  2469	The dust thy courser's hoof, rude stranger! spurns around.
  2470	
  2471	XCI.
  2472	
  2473	   Yet to the remnants of thy splendour past
  2474	   Shall pilgrims, pensive, but unwearied, throng:
  2475	   Long shall the voyager, with th' Ionian blast,
  2476	   Hail the bright clime of battle and of song;
  2477	   Long shall thine annals and immortal tongue
  2478	   Fill with thy fame the youth of many a shore:
  2479	   Boast of the aged! lesson of the young!
  2480	   Which sages venerate and bards adore,
  2481	As Pallas and the Muse unveil their awful lore.
  2482	
  2483	XCII.
  2484	
  2485	   The parted bosom clings to wonted home,
  2486	   If aught that's kindred cheer the welcome hearth;
  2487	   He that is lonely, hither let him roam,
  2488	   And gaze complacent on congenial earth.
  2489	   Greece is no lightsome land of social mirth;
  2490	   But he whom Sadness sootheth may abide,
  2491	   And scarce regret the region of his birth,
  2492	   When wandering slow by Delphi's sacred side,
  2493	Or gazing o'er the plains where Greek and Persian died.
  2494	
  2495	XCIII.
  2496	
  2497	   Let such approach this consecrated land,
  2498	   And pass in peace along the magic waste:
  2499	   But spare its relics--let no busy hand
  2500	   Deface the scenes, already how defaced!
  2501	   Not for such purpose were these altars placed.
  2502	   Revere the remnants nations once revered;
  2503	   So may our country's name be undisgraced,
  2504	   So mayst thou prosper where thy youth was reared,
  2505	By every honest joy of love and life endeared!
  2506	
  2507	XCIV.
  2508	
  2509	   For thee, who thus in too protracted song
  2510	   Hath soothed thine idlesse with inglorious lays,
  2511	   Soon shall thy voice be lost amid the throng
  2512	   Of louder minstrels in these later days:
  2513	   To such resign the strife for fading bays--
  2514	   Ill may such contest now the spirit move
  2515	   Which heeds nor keen reproach nor partial praise,
  2516	   Since cold each kinder heart that might approve,
  2517	And none are left to please where none are left to love.
  2518	
  2519	XCV.
  2520	
  2521	   Thou too art gone, thou loved and lovely one!
  2522	   Whom youth and youth's affections bound to me;
  2523	   Who did for me what none beside have done,
  2524	   Nor shrank from one albeit unworthy thee.
  2525	   What is my being? thou hast ceased to be!
  2526	   Nor stayed to welcome here thy wanderer home,
  2527	   Who mourns o'er hours which we no more shall see--
  2528	   Would they had never been, or were to come!
  2529	Would he had ne'er returned to find fresh cause to roam!
  2530	
  2531	XCVI.
  2532	
  2533	   Oh! ever loving, lovely, and beloved!
  2534	   How selfish Sorrow ponders on the past,
  2535	   And clings to thoughts now better far removed!
  2536	   But Time shall tear thy shadow from me last.
  2537	   All thou couldst have of mine, stern Death, thou hast:
  2538	   The parent, friend, and now the more than friend;
  2539	   Ne'er yet for one thine arrows flew so fast,
  2540	   And grief with grief continuing still to blend,
  2541	Hath snatched the little joy that life had yet to lend.
  2542	
  2543	XCVII.
  2544	
  2545	   Then must I plunge again into the crowd,
  2546	   And follow all that Peace disdains to seek?
  2547	   Where Revel calls, and Laughter, vainly loud,
  2548	   False to the heart, distorts the hollow cheek,
  2549	   To leave the flagging spirit doubly weak!
  2550	   Still o'er the features, which perforce they cheer,
  2551	   To feign the pleasure or conceal the pique;
  2552	   Smiles form the channel of a future tear,
  2553	Or raise the writhing lip with ill-dissembled sneer.
  2554	
  2555	XCVIII.
  2556	
  2557	   What is the worst of woes that wait on age?
  2558	   What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow?
  2559	   To view each loved one blotted from life's page,
  2560	   And be alone on earth, as I am now.
  2561	   Before the Chastener humbly let me bow,
  2562	   O'er hearts divided and o'er hopes destroyed:
  2563	   Roll on, vain days! full reckless may ye flow,
  2564	   Since Time hath reft whate'er my soul enjoyed,
  2565	And with the ills of eld mine earlier years alloyed.
  2566	
  2567	
  2568	
  2569	
  2570	CANTO THE THIRD.
  2571	
  2572	
  2573	
  2574	I.
  2575	
  2576	   Is thy face like thy mother's, my fair child!
  2577	   Ada! sole daughter of my house and heart?
  2578	   When last I saw thy young blue eyes, they smiled,
  2579	   And then we parted,--not as now we part,
  2580	   But with a hope.--
  2581	                    Awaking with a start,
  2582	   The waters heave around me; and on high
  2583	   The winds lift up their voices:  I depart,
  2584	   Whither I know not; but the hour's gone by,
  2585	When Albion's lessening shores could grieve or glad mine eye.
  2586	
  2587	II.
  2588	
  2589	   Once more upon the waters! yet once more!
  2590	   And the waves bound beneath me as a steed
  2591	   That knows his rider.  Welcome to their roar!
  2592	   Swift be their guidance, wheresoe'er it lead!
  2593	   Though the strained mast should quiver as a reed,
  2594	   And the rent canvas fluttering strew the gale,
  2595	   Still must I on; for I am as a weed,
  2596	   Flung from the rock, on Ocean's foam, to sail
  2597	Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail.
  2598	
  2599	III.
  2600	
  2601	   In my youth's summer I did sing of One,
  2602	   The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;
  2603	   Again I seize the theme, then but begun,
  2604	   And bear it with me, as the rushing wind
  2605	   Bears the cloud onwards:  in that tale I find
  2606	   The furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears,
  2607	   Which, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,
  2608	   O'er which all heavily the journeying years
  2609	Plod the last sands of life--where not a flower appears.
  2610	
  2611	IV.
  2612	
  2613	   Since my young days of passion--joy, or pain,
  2614	   Perchance my heart and harp have lost a string,
  2615	   And both may jar:  it may be, that in vain
  2616	   I would essay as I have sung to sing.
  2617	   Yet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling,
  2618	   So that it wean me from the weary dream
  2619	   Of selfish grief or gladness--so it fling
  2620	   Forgetfulness around me--it shall seem
  2621	To me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme.
  2622	
  2623	V.
  2624	
  2625	   He who, grown aged in this world of woe,
  2626	   In deeds, not years, piercing the depths of life,
  2627	   So that no wonder waits him; nor below
  2628	   Can love or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,
  2629	   Cut to his heart again with the keen knife
  2630	   Of silent, sharp endurance:  he can tell
  2631	   Why thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife
  2632	   With airy images, and shapes which dwell
  2633	Still unimpaired, though old, in the soul's haunted cell.
  2634	
  2635	VI.
  2636	
  2637	   'Tis to create, and in creating live
  2638	   A being more intense, that we endow
  2639	   With form our fancy, gaining as we give
  2640	   The life we image, even as I do now.
  2641	   What am I?  Nothing:  but not so art thou,
  2642	   Soul of my thought! with whom I traverse earth,
  2643	   Invisible but gazing, as I glow
  2644	   Mixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,
  2645	And feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings' dearth.
  2646	
  2647	VII.
  2648	
  2649	   Yet must I think less wildly:  I HAVE thought
  2650	   Too long and darkly, till my brain became,
  2651	   In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,
  2652	   A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:
  2653	   And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,
  2654	   My springs of life were poisoned.  'Tis too late!
  2655	   Yet am I changed; though still enough the same
  2656	   In strength to bear what time cannot abate,
  2657	And feed on bitter fruits without accusing fate.
  2658	
  2659	VIII.
  2660	
  2661	   Something too much of this:  but now 'tis past,
  2662	   And the spell closes with its silent seal.
  2663	   Long-absent Ivan reappears at last;
  2664	   He of the breast which fain no more would feel,
  2665	   Wrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;
  2666	   Yet Time, who changes all, had altered him
  2667	   In soul and aspect as in age:  years steal
  2668	   Fire from the mind as vigour from the limb;
  2669	And life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim.
  2670	
  2671	IX.
  2672	
  2673	   His had been quaffed too quickly, and he found
  2674	   The dregs were wormwood; but he filled again,
  2675	   And from a purer fount, on holier ground,
  2676	   And deemed its spring perpetual; but in vain!
  2677	   Still round him clung invisibly a chain
  2678	   Which galled for ever, fettering though unseen,
  2679	   And heavy though it clanked not; worn with pain,
  2680	   Which pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,
  2681	Entering with every step he took through many a scene.
  2682	
  2683	X.
  2684	
  2685	   Secure in guarded coldness, he had mixed
  2686	   Again in fancied safety with his kind,
  2687	   And deemed his spirit now so firmly fixed
  2688	   And sheathed with an invulnerable mind,
  2689	   That, if no joy, no sorrow lurked behind;
  2690	   And he, as one, might midst the many stand
  2691	   Unheeded, searching through the crowd to find
  2692	   Fit speculation; such as in strange land
  2693	He found in wonder-works of God and Nature's hand.
  2694	
  2695	XI.
  2696	
  2697	   But who can view the ripened rose, nor seek
  2698	   To wear it? who can curiously behold
  2699	   The smoothness and the sheen of beauty's cheek,
  2700	   Nor feel the heart can never all grow old?
  2701	   Who can contemplate fame through clouds unfold
  2702	   The star which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?
  2703	   Ivan, once more within the vortex rolled
  2704	   On with the giddy circle, chasing Time,
  2705	Yet with a nobler aim than in his youth's fond prime.
  2706	
  2707	XII.
  2708	
  2709	   But soon he knew himself the most unfit
  2710	   Of men to herd with Man; with whom he held
  2711	   Little in common; untaught to submit
  2712	   His thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled,
  2713	   In youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,
  2714	   He would not yield dominion of his mind
  2715	   To spirits against whom his own rebelled;
  2716	   Proud though in desolation; which could find
  2717	A life within itself, to breathe without mankind.
  2718	
  2719	XIII.
  2720	
  2721	   Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;
  2722	   Where rolled the ocean, thereon was his home;
  2723	   Where a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,
  2724	   He had the passion and the power to roam;
  2725	   The desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,
  2726	   Were unto him companionship; they spake
  2727	   A mutual language, clearer than the tome
  2728	   Of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake
  2729	For nature's pages glassed by sunbeams on the lake.
  2730	
  2731	XIV.
  2732	
  2733	   Like the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,
  2734	   Till he had peopled them with beings bright
  2735	   As their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,
  2736	   And human frailties, were forgotten quite:
  2737	   Could he have kept his spirit to that flight,
  2738	   He had been happy; but this clay will sink
  2739	   Its spark immortal, envying it the light
  2740	   To which it mounts, as if to break the link
  2741	That keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.
  2742	
  2743	XV.
  2744	
  2745	   But in Man's dwellings he became a thing
  2746	   Restless and worn, and stern and wearisome,
  2747	   Drooped as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,
  2748	   To whom the boundless air alone were home:
  2749	   Then came his fit again, which to o'ercome,
  2750	   As eagerly the barred-up bird will beat
  2751	   His breast and beak against his wiry dome
  2752	   Till the blood tinge his plumage, so the heat
  2753	Of his impeded soul would through his bosom eat.
  2754	
  2755	XVI.
  2756	
  2757	   Self-exiled Ivan wanders forth again,
  2758	   With naught of hope left, but with less of gloom;
  2759	   The very knowledge that he lived in vain,
  2760	   That all was over on this side the tomb,
  2761	   Had made Despair a smilingness assume,
  2762	   Which, though 'twere wild--as on the plundered wreck
  2763	   When mariners would madly meet their doom
  2764	   With draughts intemperate on the sinking deck--
  2765	Did yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check.
  2766	
  2767	XVII.
  2768	
  2769	   Stop! for thy tread is on an empire's dust!
  2770	   An earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!
  2771	   Is the spot marked with no colossal bust?
  2772	   Nor column trophied for triumphal show?
  2773	   None; but the moral's truth tells simpler so,
  2774	   As the ground was before, thus let it be;--
  2775	   How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!
  2776	   And is this all the world has gained by thee,
  2777	Thou first and last of fields! king-making Victory?
  2778	
  2779	XVIII.
  2780	
  2781	   And Ivan stands upon this place of skulls,
  2782	   The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!
  2783	   How in an hour the power which gave annuls
  2784	   Its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!
  2785	   In 'pride of place' here last the eagle flew,
  2786	   Then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,
  2787	   Pierced by the shaft of banded nations through:
  2788	   Ambition's life and labours all were vain;
  2789	He wears the shattered links of the world's broken chain.
  2790	
  2791	XIX.
  2792	
  2793	   Fit retribution!  Gaul may champ the bit,
  2794	   And foam in fetters, but is Earth more free?
  2795	   Did nations combat to make ONE submit;
  2796	   Or league to teach all kings true sovereignty?
  2797	   What! shall reviving thraldom again be
  2798	   The patched-up idol of enlightened days?
  2799	   Shall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we
  2800	   Pay the Wolf homage? proffering lowly gaze
  2801	And servile knees to thrones?  No; PROVE before ye praise!
  2802	
  2803	XX.
  2804	
  2805	   If not, o'er one fall'n despot boast no more!
  2806	   In vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears
  2807	   For Europe's flowers long rooted up before
  2808	   The trampler of her vineyards; in vain years
  2809	   Of death, depopulation, bondage, fears,
  2810	   Have all been borne, and broken by the accord
  2811	   Of roused-up millions:  all that most endears
  2812	   Glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a sword
  2813	Such as Harmodius drew on Athens' tyrant lord.
  2814	
  2815	XXI.
  2816	
  2817	   There was a sound of revelry by night,
  2818	   And Belgium's capital had gathered then
  2819	   Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright
  2820	   The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
  2821	   A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
  2822	   Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
  2823	   Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
  2824	   And all went merry as a marriage bell;
  2825	But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!
  2826	
  2827	XXII.
  2828	
  2829	   Did ye not hear it?--No; 'twas but the wind,
  2830	   Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;
  2831	   On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
  2832	   No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
  2833	   To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet.
  2834	   But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,
  2835	   As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
  2836	   And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!
  2837	Arm! arm! it is--it is--the cannon's opening roar!
  2838	
  2839	XXIII.
  2840	
  2841	   Within a windowed niche of that high hall
  2842	   Sate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear
  2843	   That sound, the first amidst the festival,
  2844	   And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
  2845	   And when they smiled because he deemed it near,
  2846	   His heart more truly knew that peal too well
  2847	   Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
  2848	   And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:
  2849	He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.
  2850	
  2851	XXIV.
  2852	
  2853	   Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
  2854	   And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
  2855	   And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
  2856	   Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
  2857	   And there were sudden partings, such as press
  2858	   The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
  2859	   Which ne'er might be repeated:  who would guess
  2860	   If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
  2861	Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!
  2862	
  2863	XXV.
  2864	
  2865	   And there was mounting in hot haste:  the steed,
  2866	   The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
  2867	   Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
  2868	   And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
  2869	   And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
  2870	   And near, the beat of the alarming drum
  2871	   Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
  2872	   While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
  2873	Or whispering, with white lips--'The foe!  They come! they come!'
  2874	
  2875	XXVI.
  2876	
  2877	   And wild and high the 'Cameron's gathering' rose,
  2878	   The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills
  2879	   Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes:
  2880	   How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills
  2881	   Savage and shrill!  But with the breath which fills
  2882	   Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers
  2883	   With the fierce native daring which instils
  2884	   The stirring memory of a thousand years,
  2885	And Evan's, Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears.
  2886	
  2887	XXVII.
  2888	
  2889	   And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,
  2890	   Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass,
  2891	   Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
  2892	   Over the unreturniug brave,--alas!
  2893	   Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
  2894	   Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
  2895	   In its next verdure, when this fiery mass
  2896	   Of living valour, rolling on the foe,
  2897	And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.
  2898	
  2899	XXVIII.
  2900	
  2901	   Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,
  2902	   Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,
  2903	   The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,
  2904	   The morn the marshalling in arms,--the day
  2905	   Battle's magnificently stern array!
  2906	   The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent
  2907	   The earth is covered thick with other clay,
  2908	   Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,
  2909	Rider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent!
  2910	
  2911	XXIX.
  2912	
  2913	   Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;
  2914	   Yet one I would select from that proud throng,
  2915	   Partly because they blend me with his line,
  2916	   And partly that I did his sire some wrong,
  2917	   And partly that bright names will hallow song;
  2918	   And his was of the bravest, and when showered
  2919	   The death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,
  2920	   Even where the thickest of war's tempest lowered,
  2921	They reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!
  2922	
  2923	XXX.
  2924	
  2925	   There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,
  2926	   And mine were nothing, had I such to give;
  2927	   But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,
  2928	   Which living waves where thou didst cease to live,
  2929	   And saw around me the wild field revive
  2930	   With fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring
  2931	   Come forth her work of gladness to contrive,
  2932	   With all her reckless birds upon the wing,
  2933	I turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.
  2934	
  2935	XXXI.
  2936	
  2937	   I turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each
  2938	   And one as all a ghastly gap did make
  2939	   In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach
  2940	   Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;
  2941	   The Archangel's trump, not Glory's, must awake
  2942	   Those whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame
  2943	   May for a moment soothe, it cannot slake
  2944	   The fever of vain longing, and the name
  2945	So honoured, but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.
  2946	
  2947	XXXII.
  2948	
  2949	   They mourn, but smile at length; and, smiling, mourn:
  2950	   The tree will wither long before it fall:
  2951	   The hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;
  2952	   The roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall
  2953	   In massy hoariness; the ruined wall
  2954	   Stands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;
  2955	   The bars survive the captive they enthral;
  2956	   The day drags through though storms keep out the sun;
  2957	And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:
  2958	
  2959	XXXIII.
  2960	
  2961	   E'en as a broken mirror, which the glass
  2962	   In every fragment multiplies; and makes
  2963	   A thousand images of one that was,
  2964	   The same, and still the more, the more it breaks;
  2965	   And thus the heart will do which not forsakes,
  2966	   Living in shattered guise, and still, and cold,
  2967	   And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,
  2968	   Yet withers on till all without is old,
  2969	Showing no visible sign, for such things are untold.
  2970	
  2971	XXXIV.
  2972	
  2973	   There is a very life in our despair,
  2974	   Vitality of poison,--a quick root
  2975	   Which feeds these deadly branches; for it were
  2976	   As nothing did we die; but life will suit
  2977	   Itself to Sorrow's most detested fruit,
  2978	   Like to the apples on the Dead Sea shore,
  2979	   All ashes to the taste:  Did man compute
  2980	   Existence by enjoyment, and count o'er
  2981	Such hours 'gainst years of life,--say, would he name threescore?
  2982	
  2983	XXXV.
  2984	
  2985	   The Psalmist numbered out the years of man:
  2986	   They are enough:  and if thy tale be TRUE,
  2987	   Thou, who didst grudge him e'en that fleeting span,
  2988	   More than enough, thou fatal Waterloo!
  2989	   Millions of tongues record thee, and anew
  2990	   Their children's lips shall echo them, and say,
  2991	   'Here, where the sword united nations drew,
  2992	   Our countrymen were warring on that day!'
  2993	And this is much, and all which will not pass away.
  2994	
  2995	XXXVI.
  2996	
  2997	   There sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,
  2998	   Whose spirit anithetically mixed
  2999	   One moment of the mightiest, and again
  3000	   On little objects with like firmness fixed;
  3001	   Extreme in all things! hadst thou been betwixt,
  3002	   Thy throne had still been thine, or never been;
  3003	   For daring made thy rise as fall:  thou seek'st
  3004	   Even now to reassume the imperial mien,
  3005	And shake again the world, the Thunderer of the scene!
  3006	
  3007	XXXVII.
  3008	
  3009	   Conqueror and captive of the earth art thou!
  3010	   She trembles at thee still, and thy wild name
  3011	   Was ne'er more bruited in men's minds than now
  3012	   That thou art nothing, save the jest of Fame,
  3013	   Who wooed thee once, thy vassal, and became
  3014	   The flatterer of thy fierceness, till thou wert
  3015	   A god unto thyself; nor less the same
  3016	   To the astounded kingdoms all inert,
  3017	Who deemed thee for a time whate'er thou didst assert.
  3018	
  3019	XXXVIII.
  3020	
  3021	   Oh, more or less than man--in high or low,
  3022	   Battling with nations, flying from the field;
  3023	   Now making monarchs' necks thy footstool, now
  3024	   More than thy meanest soldier taught to yield:
  3025	   An empire thou couldst crush, command, rebuild,
  3026	   But govern not thy pettiest passion, nor,
  3027	   However deeply in men's spirits skilled,
  3028	   Look through thine own, nor curb the lust of war,
  3029	Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest star.
  3030	
  3031	XXXIX.
  3032	
  3033	   Yet well thy soul hath brooked the turning tide
  3034	   With that untaught innate philosophy,
  3035	   Which, be it wisdom, coldness, or deep pride,
  3036	   Is gall and wormwood to an enemy.
  3037	   When the whole host of hatred stood hard by,
  3038	   To watch and mock thee shrinking, thou hast smiled
  3039	   With a sedate and all-enduring eye;
  3040	   When Fortune fled her spoiled and favourite child,
  3041	He stood unbowed beneath the ills upon him piled.
  3042	
  3043	XL.
  3044	
  3045	   Sager than in thy fortunes; for in them
  3046	   Ambition steeled thee on to far too show
  3047	   That just habitual scorn, which could contemn
  3048	   Men and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so
  3049	   To wear it ever on thy lip and brow,
  3050	   And spurn the instruments thou wert to use
  3051	   Till they were turned unto thine overthrow:
  3052	   'Tis but a worthless world to win or lose;
  3053	So hath it proved to thee, and all such lot who choose.
  3054	
  3055	XLI.
  3056	
  3057	   If, like a tower upon a headland rock,
  3058	   Thou hadst been made to stand or fall alone,
  3059	   Such scorn of man had helped to brave the shock;
  3060	   But men's thoughts were the steps which paved thy throne,
  3061	   THEIR admiration thy best weapon shone;
  3062	   The part of Philip's son was thine, not then
  3063	   (Unless aside thy purple had been thrown)
  3064	   Like stern Diogenes to mock at men;
  3065	For sceptred cynics earth were far too wide a den.
  3066	
  3067	XLII.
  3068	
  3069	   But quiet to quick bosoms is a hell,
  3070	   And THERE hath been thy bane; there is a fire
  3071	   And motion of the soul, which will not dwell
  3072	   In its own narrow being, but aspire
  3073	   Beyond the fitting medium of desire;
  3074	   And, but once kindled, quenchless evermore,
  3075	   Preys upon high adventure, nor can tire
  3076	   Of aught but rest; a fever at the core,
  3077	Fatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore.
  3078	
  3079	XLIII.
  3080	
  3081	   This makes the madmen who have made men mad
  3082	   By their contagion!  Conquerors and Kings,
  3083	   Founders of sects and systems, to whom add
  3084	   Sophists, Bards, Statesmen, all unquiet things
  3085	   Which stir too strongly the soul's secret springs,
  3086	   And are themselves the fools to those they fool;
  3087	   Envied, yet how unenviable! what stings
  3088	   Are theirs!  One breast laid open were a school
  3089	Which would unteach mankind the lust to shine or rule:
  3090	
  3091	XLIV.
  3092	
  3093	   Their breath is agitation, and their life
  3094	   A storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,
  3095	   And yet so nursed and bigoted to strife,
  3096	   That should their days, surviving perils past,
  3097	   Melt to calm twilight, they feel overcast
  3098	   With sorrow and supineness, and so die;
  3099	   Even as a flame unfed, which runs to waste
  3100	   With its own flickering, or a sword laid by,
  3101	Which eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously.
  3102	
  3103	XLV.
  3104	
  3105	   He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find
  3106	   The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;
  3107	   He who surpasses or subdues mankind,
  3108	   Must look down on the hate of those below.
  3109	   Though high ABOVE the sun of glory glow,
  3110	   And far BENEATH the earth and ocean spread,
  3111	   ROUND him are icy rocks, and loudly blow
  3112	   Contending tempests on his naked head,
  3113	And thus reward the toils which to those summits led.
  3114	
  3115	XLVI.
  3116	
  3117	   Away with these; true Wisdom's world will be
  3118	   Within its own creation, or in thine,
  3119	   Maternal Nature! for who teems like thee,
  3120	   Thus on the banks of thy majestic Rhine?
  3121	   There Ivan gazes on a work divine,
  3122	   A blending of all beauties; streams and dells,
  3123	   Fruit, foliage, crag, wood, corn-field, mountain, vine,
  3124	   And chiefless castles breathing stern farewells
  3125	From grey but leafy walls, where Ruin greenly dwells.
  3126	
  3127	XLVII.
  3128	
  3129	   And there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,
  3130	   Worn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,
  3131	   All tenantless, save to the crannying wind,
  3132	   Or holding dark communion with the cloud.
  3133	   There was a day when they were young and proud,
  3134	   Banners on high, and battles passed below;
  3135	   But they who fought are in a bloody shroud,
  3136	   And those which waved are shredless dust ere now,
  3137	And the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow.
  3138	
  3139	XLVIII.
  3140	
  3141	   Beneath these battlements, within those walls,
  3142	   Power dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state
  3143	   Each robber chief upheld his armed halls,
  3144	   Doing his evil will, nor less elate
  3145	   Than mightier heroes of a longer date.
  3146	   What want these outlaws conquerors should have
  3147	   But History's purchased page to call them great?
  3148	   A wider space, an ornamented grave?
  3149	Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.
  3150	
  3151	XLIX.
  3152	
  3153	   In their baronial feuds and single fields,
  3154	   What deeds of prowess unrecorded died!
  3155	   And Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,
  3156	   With emblems well devised by amorous pride,
  3157	   Through all the mail of iron hearts would glide;
  3158	   But still their flame was fierceness, and drew on
  3159	   Keen contest and destruction near allied,
  3160	   And many a tower for some fair mischief won,
  3161	Saw the discoloured Rhine beneath its ruin run.
  3162	
  3163	L.
  3164	
  3165	   But thou, exulting and abounding river!
  3166	   Making thy waves a blessing as they flow
  3167	   Through banks whose beauty would endure for ever,
  3168	   Could man but leave thy bright creation so,
  3169	   Nor its fair promise from the surface mow
  3170	   With the sharp scythe of conflict,--then to see
  3171	   Thy valley of sweet waters, were to know
  3172	   Earth paved like Heaven; and to seem such to me
  3173	Even now what wants thy stream?--that it should Lethe be.
  3174	
  3175	LI.
  3176	
  3177	   A thousand battles have assailed thy banks,
  3178	   But these and half their fame have passed away,
  3179	   And Slaughter heaped on high his weltering ranks:
  3180	   Their very graves are gone, and what are they?
  3181	   Thy tide washed down the blood of yesterday,
  3182	   And all was stainless, and on thy clear stream
  3183	   Glassed with its dancing light the sunny ray;
  3184	   But o'er the blackened memory's blighting dream
  3185	Thy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem.
  3186	
  3187	LII.
  3188	
  3189	   Thus Ivan inly said, and passed along,
  3190	   Yet not insensible to all which here
  3191	   Awoke the jocund birds to early song
  3192	   In glens which might have made e'en exile dear:
  3193	   Though on his brow were graven lines austere,
  3194	   And tranquil sternness which had ta'en the place
  3195	   Of feelings fierier far but less severe,
  3196	   Joy was not always absent from his face,
  3197	But o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace.
  3198	
  3199	LIII.
  3200	
  3201	   Nor was all love shut from him, though his days
  3202	   Of passion had consumed themselves to dust.
  3203	   It is in vain that we would coldly gaze
  3204	   On such as smile upon us; the heart must
  3205	   Leap kindly back to kindness, though disgust
  3206	   Hath weaned it from all worldlings:  thus he felt,
  3207	   For there was soft remembrance, and sweet trust
  3208	   In one fond breast, to which his own would melt,
  3209	And in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt.
  3210	
  3211	LIV.
  3212	
  3213	   And he had learned to love,--I know not why,
  3214	   For this in such as him seems strange of mood,--
  3215	   The helpless looks of blooming infancy,
  3216	   Even in its earliest nurture; what subdued,
  3217	   To change like this, a mind so far imbued
  3218	   With scorn of man, it little boots to know;
  3219	   But thus it was; and though in solitude
  3220	   Small power the nipped affections have to grow,
  3221	In him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow.
  3222	
  3223	LV.
  3224	
  3225	   And there was one soft breast, as hath been said,
  3226	   Which unto his was bound by stronger ties
  3227	   Than the church links withal; and, though unwed,
  3228	   THAT love was pure, and, far above disguise,
  3229	   Had stood the test of mortal enmities
  3230	   Still undivided, and cemented more
  3231	   By peril, dreaded most in female eyes;
  3232	   But this was firm, and from a foreign shore
  3233	Well to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!
  3234	
  3235	   The castled crag of Drachenfels
  3236	   Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine.
  3237	   Whose breast of waters broadly swells
  3238	   Between the banks which bear the vine,
  3239	   And hills all rich with blossomed trees,
  3240	   And fields which promise corn and wine,
  3241	   And scattered cities crowning these,
  3242	   Whose far white walls along them shine,
  3243	   Have strewed a scene, which I should see
  3244	   With double joy wert THOU with me!
  3245	
  3246	   And peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,
  3247	   And hands which offer early flowers,
  3248	   Walk smiling o'er this paradise;
  3249	   Above, the frequent feudal towers
  3250	   Through green leaves lift their walls of grey,
  3251	   And many a rock which steeply lours,
  3252	   And noble arch in proud decay,
  3253	   Look o'er this vale of vintage bowers:
  3254	   But one thing want these banks of Rhine,--
  3255	   Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine!
  3256	
  3257	   I send the lilies given to me;
  3258	   Though long before thy hand they touch,
  3259	   I know that they must withered be,
  3260	   But yet reject them not as such;
  3261	   For I have cherished them as dear,
  3262	   Because they yet may meet thine eye,
  3263	   And guide thy soul to mine e'en here,
  3264	   When thou behold'st them drooping nigh,
  3265	   And know'st them gathered by the Rhine,
  3266	   And offered from my heart to thine!
  3267	
  3268	   The river nobly foams and flows,
  3269	   The charm of this enchanted ground,
  3270	   And all its thousand turns disclose
  3271	   Some fresher beauty varying round;
  3272	   The haughtiest breast its wish might bound
  3273	   Through life to dwell delighted here;
  3274	   Nor could on earth a spot be found
  3275	   To Nature and to me so dear,
  3276	   Could thy dear eyes in following mine
  3277	   Still sweeten more these banks of Rhine!
  3278	
  3279	LVI.
  3280	
  3281	   By Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,
  3282	   There is a small and simple pyramid,
  3283	   Crowning the summit of the verdant mound;
  3284	   Beneath its base are heroes' ashes hid,
  3285	   Our enemy's,--but let not that forbid
  3286	   Honour to Marceau! o'er whose early tomb
  3287	   Tears, big tears, gushed from the rough soldier's lid,
  3288	   Lamenting and yet envying such a doom,
  3289	Falling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.
  3290	
  3291	LVI.
  3292	
  3293	   Brief, brave, and glorious was his young career,--
  3294	   His mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;
  3295	   And fitly may the stranger lingering here
  3296	   Pray for his gallant spirit's bright repose;
  3297	   For he was Freedom's champion, one of those,
  3298	   The few in number, who had not o'erstept
  3299	   The charter to chastise which she bestows
  3300	   On such as wield her weapons; he had kept
  3301	The whiteness of his soul, and thus men o'er him wept.
  3302	
  3303	LVIII.
  3304	
  3305	   Here Ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall
  3306	   Black with the miner's blast, upon her height
  3307	   Yet shows of what she was, when shell and ball
  3308	   Rebounding idly on her strength did light;
  3309	   A tower of victory! from whence the flight
  3310	   Of baffled foes was watched along the plain;
  3311	   But Peace destroyed what War could never blight,
  3312	   And laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain--
  3313	On which the iron shower for years had poured in vain.
  3314	
  3315	LIX.
  3316	
  3317	   Adieu to thee, fair Rhine!  How long, delighted,
  3318	   The stranger fain would linger on his way;
  3319	   Thine is a scene alike where souls united
  3320	   Or lonely Contemplation thus might stray;
  3321	   And could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey
  3322	   On self-condemning bosoms, it were here,
  3323	   Where Nature, not too sombre nor too gay,
  3324	   Wild but not rude, awful yet not austere,
  3325	Is to the mellow earth as autumn to the year.
  3326	
  3327	LX.
  3328	
  3329	   Adieu to thee again! a vain adieu!
  3330	   There can be no farewell to scene like thine;
  3331	   The mind is coloured by thy every hue;
  3332	   And if reluctantly the eyes resign
  3333	   Their cherished gaze upon thee, lovely Rhine!
  3334	   'Tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;
  3335	   More mighty spots may rise--more glaring shine,
  3336	   But none unite in one attaching maze
  3337	The brilliant, fair, and soft;--the glories of old days.
  3338	
  3339	LXI.
  3340	
  3341	   The negligently grand, the fruitful bloom
  3342	   Of coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,
  3343	   The rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,
  3344	   The forest's growth, and Gothic walls between,
  3345	   The wild rocks shaped as they had turrets been
  3346	   In mockery of man's art; and these withal
  3347	   A race of faces happy as the scene,
  3348	   Whose fertile bounties here extend to all,
  3349	Still springing o'er thy banks, though empires near them fall.
  3350	
  3351	LXII.
  3352	
  3353	   But these recede.  Above me are the Alps,
  3354	   The palaces of Nature, whose vast walls
  3355	   Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,
  3356	   And throned Eternity in icy halls
  3357	   Of cold sublimity, where forms and falls
  3358	   The avalanche--the thunderbolt of snow!
  3359	   All that expands the spirit, yet appals,
  3360	   Gathers around these summits, as to show
  3361	How Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below.
  3362	
  3363	LXIII.
  3364	
  3365	   But ere these matchless heights I dare to scan,
  3366	   There is a spot should not be passed in vain,--
  3367	   Morat! the proud, the patriot field! where man
  3368	   May gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,
  3369	   Nor blush for those who conquered on that plain;
  3370	   Here Burgundy bequeathed his tombless host,
  3371	   A bony heap, through ages to remain,
  3372	   Themselves their monument;--the Stygian coast
  3373	Unsepulchred they roamed, and shrieked each wandering ghost.
  3374	
  3375	LXIV.
  3376	
  3377	   While Waterloo with Cannae's carnage vies,
  3378	   Morat and Marathon twin names shall stand;
  3379	   They were true Glory's stainless victories,
  3380	   Won by the unambitious heart and hand
  3381	   Of a proud, brotherly, and civic band,
  3382	   All unbought champions in no princely cause
  3383	   Of vice-entailed Corruption; they no land
  3384	   Doomed to bewail the blasphemy of laws
  3385	Making king's rights divine, by some Draconic clause.
  3386	
  3387	LXV.
  3388	
  3389	   By a lone wall a lonelier column rears
  3390	   A grey and grief-worn aspect of old days
  3391	   'Tis the last remnant of the wreck of years,
  3392	   And looks as with the wild bewildered gaze
  3393	   Of one to stone converted by amaze,
  3394	   Yet still with consciousness; and there it stands,
  3395	   Making a marvel that it not decays,
  3396	   When the coeval pride of human hands,
  3397	Levelled Aventicum, hath strewed her subject lands.
  3398	
  3399	LXVI.
  3400	
  3401	   And there--oh! sweet and sacred be the name!--
  3402	   Julia--the daughter, the devoted--gave
  3403	   Her youth to Heaven; her heart, beneath a claim
  3404	   Nearest to Heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.
  3405	   Justice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave
  3406	   The life she lived in; but the judge was just,
  3407	   And then she died on him she could not save.
  3408	   Their tomb was simple, and without a bust,
  3409	And held within their urn one mind, one heart, one dust.
  3410	
  3411	LXVII.
  3412	
  3413	   But these are deeds which should not pass away,
  3414	   And names that must not wither, though the earth
  3415	   Forgets her empires with a just decay,
  3416	   The enslavers and the enslaved, their death and birth;
  3417	   The high, the mountain-majesty of worth,
  3418	   Should be, and shall, survivor of its woe,
  3419	   And from its immortality look forth
  3420	   In the sun's face, like yonder Alpine snow,
  3421	Imperishably pure beyond all things below.
  3422	
  3423	LXVIII.
  3424	
  3425	   Lake Leman woos me with its crystal face,
  3426	   The mirror where the stars and mountains view
  3427	   The stillness of their aspect in each trace
  3428	   Its clear depth yields of their far height and hue:
  3429	   There is too much of man here, to look through
  3430	   With a fit mind the might which I behold;
  3431	   But soon in me shall Loneliness renew
  3432	   Thoughts hid, but not less cherished than of old,
  3433	Ere mingling with the herd had penned me in their fold.
  3434	
  3435	LXIX.
  3436	
  3437	   To fly from, need not be to hate, mankind;
  3438	   All are not fit with them to stir and toil,
  3439	   Nor is it discontent to keep the mind
  3440	   Deep in its fountain, lest it overboil
  3441	   In one hot throng, where we become the spoil
  3442	   Of our infection, till too late and long
  3443	   We may deplore and struggle with the coil,
  3444	   In wretched interchange of wrong for wrong
  3445	Midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.
  3446	
  3447	LXX.
  3448	
  3449	   There, in a moment, we may plunge our years
  3450	   In fatal penitence, and in the blight
  3451	   Of our own soul, turn all our blood to tears,
  3452	   And colour things to come with hues of Night;
  3453	   The race of life becomes a hopeless flight
  3454	   To those that walk in darkness:  on the sea,
  3455	   The boldest steer but where their ports invite,
  3456	   But there are wanderers o'er Eternity
  3457	Whose bark drives on and on, and anchored ne'er shall be.
  3458	
  3459	LXXI.
  3460	
  3461	   Is it not better, then, to be alone,
  3462	   And love Earth only for its earthly sake?
  3463	   By the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,
  3464	   Or the pure bosom of its nursing lake,
  3465	   Which feeds it as a mother who doth make
  3466	   A fair but froward infant her own care,
  3467	   Kissing its cries away as these awake;--
  3468	   Is it not better thus our lives to wear,
  3469	Than join the crushing crowd, doomed to inflict or bear?
  3470	
  3471	LXXII.
  3472	
  3473	   I live not in myself, but I become
  3474	   Portion of that around me; and to me,
  3475	   High mountains are a feeling, but the hum
  3476	   Of human cities torture:  I can see
  3477	   Nothing to loathe in Nature, save to be
  3478	   A link reluctant in a fleshly chain,
  3479	   Classed among creatures, when the soul can flee,
  3480	   And with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain
  3481	Of ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.
  3482	
  3483	LXXIII.
  3484	
  3485	   And thus I am absorbed, and this is life:
  3486	   I look upon the peopled desert Past,
  3487	   As on a place of agony and strife,
  3488	   Where, for some sin, to Sorrow I was cast,
  3489	   To act and suffer, but remount at last
  3490	   With a fresh pinion; which I felt to spring,
  3491	   Though young, yet waxing vigorous as the blast
  3492	   Which it would cope with, on delighted wing,
  3493	Spurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.
  3494	
  3495	LXXIV.
  3496	
  3497	   And when, at length, the mind shall be all free
  3498	   From what it hates in this degraded form,
  3499	   Reft of its carnal life, save what shall be
  3500	   Existent happier in the fly and worm,--
  3501	   When elements to elements conform,
  3502	   And dust is as it should be, shall I not
  3503	   Feel all I see, less dazzling, but more warm?
  3504	   The bodiless thought? the Spirit of each spot?
  3505	Of which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?
  3506	
  3507	LXXV.
  3508	
  3509	   Are not the mountains, waves, and skies a part
  3510	   Of me and of my soul, as I of them?
  3511	   Is not the love of these deep in my heart
  3512	   With a pure passion? should I not contemn
  3513	   All objects, if compared with these? and stem
  3514	   A tide of suffering, rather than forego
  3515	   Such feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm
  3516	   Of those whose eyes are only turned below,
  3517	Gazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?
  3518	
  3519	LXXVI.
  3520	
  3521	   But this is not my theme; and I return
  3522	   To that which is immediate, and require
  3523	   Those who find contemplation in the urn,
  3524	   To look on One whose dust was once all fire,
  3525	   A native of the land where I respire
  3526	   The clear air for awhile--a passing guest,
  3527	   Where he became a being,--whose desire
  3528	   Was to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,
  3529	The which to gain and keep he sacrificed all rest.
  3530	
  3531	LXXVII.
  3532	
  3533	   Here the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,
  3534	   The apostle of affliction, he who threw
  3535	   Enchantment over passion, and from woe
  3536	   Wrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew
  3537	   The breath which made him wretched; yet he knew
  3538	   How to make madness beautiful, and cast
  3539	   O'er erring deeds and thoughts a heavenly hue
  3540	   Of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past
  3541	The eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast.
  3542	
  3543	LXXVIII.
  3544	
  3545	   His love was passion's essence--as a tree
  3546	   On fire by lightning; with ethereal flame
  3547	   Kindled he was, and blasted; for to be
  3548	   Thus, and enamoured, were in him the same.
  3549	   But his was not the love of living dame,
  3550	   Nor of the dead who rise upon our dreams,
  3551	   But of Ideal beauty, which became
  3552	   In him existence, and o'erflowing teems
  3553	Along his burning page, distempered though it seems.
  3554	
  3555	LXXIX.
  3556	
  3557	   THIS breathed itself to life in Julie, THIS
  3558	   Invested her with all that's wild and sweet;
  3559	   This hallowed, too, the memorable kiss
  3560	   Which every morn his fevered lip would greet,
  3561	   From hers, who but with friendship his would meet:
  3562	   But to that gentle touch, through brain and breast
  3563	   Flashed the thrilled spirit's love-devouring heat;
  3564	   In that absorbing sigh perchance more blest,
  3565	Than vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest.
  3566	
  3567	LXXX.
  3568	
  3569	   His life was one long war with self-sought foes,
  3570	   Or friends by him self-banished; for his mind
  3571	   Had grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose
  3572	   For its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,
  3573	   'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.
  3574	   But he was frenzied,--wherefore, who may know?
  3575	   Since cause might be which skill could never find;
  3576	   But he was frenzied by disease or woe
  3577	To that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.
  3578	
  3579	LXXXI.
  3580	
  3581	   For then he was inspired, and from him came,
  3582	   As from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,
  3583	   Those oracles which set the world in flame,
  3584	   Nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:
  3585	   Did he not this for France, which lay before
  3586	   Bowed to the inborn tyranny of years?
  3587	   Broken and trembling to the yoke she bore,
  3588	   Till by the voice of him and his compeers
  3589	Roused up to too much wrath, which follows o'ergrown fears?
  3590	
  3591	LXXXII.
  3592	
  3593	   They made themselves a fearful monument!
  3594	   The wreck of old opinions--things which grew,
  3595	   Breathed from the birth of time:  the veil they rent,
  3596	   And what behind it lay, all earth shall view.
  3597	   But good with ill they also overthrew,
  3598	   Leaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild
  3599	   Upon the same foundation, and renew
  3600	   Dungeons and thrones, which the same hour refilled,
  3601	As heretofore, because ambition was self-willed.
  3602	
  3603	LXXXIII.
  3604	
  3605	   But this will not endure, nor be endured!
  3606	   Mankind have felt their strength, and made it felt.
  3607	   They might have used it better, but, allured
  3608	   By their new vigour, sternly have they dealt
  3609	   On one another; Pity ceased to melt
  3610	   With her once natural charities.  But they,
  3611	   Who in Oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,
  3612	   They were not eagles, nourished with the day;
  3613	What marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?
  3614	
  3615	LXXXIV.
  3616	
  3617	   What deep wounds ever closed without a scar?
  3618	   The heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear
  3619	   That which disfigures it; and they who war
  3620	   With their own hopes, and have been vanquished, bear
  3621	   Silence, but not submission:  in his lair
  3622	   Fixed Passion holds his breath, until the hour
  3623	   Which shall atone for years; none need despair:
  3624	   It came, it cometh, and will come,--the power
  3625	To punish or forgive--in ONE we shall be slower.
  3626	
  3627	LXXXV.
  3628	
  3629	   Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,
  3630	   With the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing
  3631	   Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake
  3632	   Earth's troubled waters for a purer spring.
  3633	   This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing
  3634	   To waft me from distraction; once I loved
  3635	   Torn ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring
  3636	   Sounds sweet as if a sister's voice reproved,
  3637	That I with stern delights should e'er have been so moved.
  3638	
  3639	LXXXVI.
  3640	
  3641	   It is the hush of night, and all between
  3642	   Thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,
  3643	   Mellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen.
  3644	   Save darkened Jura, whose capt heights appear
  3645	   Precipitously steep; and drawing near,
  3646	   There breathes a living fragrance from the shore,
  3647	   Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear
  3648	   Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,
  3649	Or chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more;
  3650	
  3651	LXXXVII.
  3652	
  3653	   He is an evening reveller, who makes
  3654	   His life an infancy, and sings his fill;
  3655	   At intervals, some bird from out the brakes
  3656	   Starts into voice a moment, then is still.
  3657	   There seems a floating whisper on the hill,
  3658	   But that is fancy, for the starlight dews
  3659	   All silently their tears of love instil,
  3660	   Weeping themselves away, till they infuse
  3661	Deep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.
  3662	
  3663	LXXXVIII.
  3664	
  3665	   Ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven,
  3666	   If in your bright leaves we would read the fate
  3667	   Of men and empires,--'tis to be forgiven,
  3668	   That in our aspirations to be great,
  3669	   Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,
  3670	   And claim a kindred with you; for ye are
  3671	   A beauty and a mystery, and create
  3672	   In us such love and reverence from afar,
  3673	That fortune, fame, power, life, have named themselves a star.
  3674	
  3675	LXXXIX.
  3676	
  3677	   All heaven and earth are still--though not in sleep,
  3678	   But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;
  3679	   And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep: --
  3680	   All heaven and earth are still:  from the high host
  3681	   Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain-coast,
  3682	   All is concentered in a life intense,
  3683	   Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,
  3684	   But hath a part of being, and a sense
  3685	Of that which is of all Creator and defence.
  3686	
  3687	XC.
  3688	
  3689	   Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt
  3690	   In solitude, where we are LEAST alone;
  3691	   A truth, which through our being then doth melt,
  3692	   And purifies from self:  it is a tone,
  3693	   The soul and source of music, which makes known
  3694	   Eternal harmony, and sheds a charm,
  3695	   Like to the fabled Cytherea's zone,
  3696	   Binding all things with beauty;--'twould disarm
  3697	The spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.
  3698	
  3699	XCI.
  3700	
  3701	   Nor vainly did the early Persian make
  3702	   His altar the high places and the peak
  3703	   Of earth-o'ergazing mountains, and thus take
  3704	   A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek
  3705	   The Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak,
  3706	   Upreared of human hands.  Come, and compare
  3707	   Columns and idol-dwellings, Goth or Greek,
  3708	   With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air,
  3709	Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!
  3710	
  3711	XCII.
  3712	
  3713	   The sky is changed!--and such a change!  O night,
  3714	   And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,
  3715	   Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light
  3716	   Of a dark eye in woman!  Far along,
  3717	   From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,
  3718	   Leaps the live thunder!  Not from one lone cloud,
  3719	   But every mountain now hath found a tongue;
  3720	   And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,
  3721	Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!
  3722	
  3723	XCIII.
  3724	
  3725	   And this is in the night:--Most glorious night!
  3726	   Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be
  3727	   A sharer in thy fierce and far delight--
  3728	   A portion of the tempest and of thee!
  3729	   How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,
  3730	   And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!
  3731	   And now again 'tis black,--and now, the glee
  3732	   Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,
  3733	As if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth.
  3734	
  3735	XCIV.
  3736	
  3737	   Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between
  3738	   Heights which appear as lovers who have parted
  3739	   In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,
  3740	   That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;
  3741	   Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,
  3742	   Love was the very root of the fond rage
  3743	   Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:
  3744	   Itself expired, but leaving them an age
  3745	Of years all winters--war within themselves to wage.
  3746	
  3747	XCV.
  3748	
  3749	   Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,
  3750	   The mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand;
  3751	   For here, not one, but many, make their play,
  3752	   And fling their thunderbolts from hand to hand,
  3753	   Flashing and cast around:  of all the band,
  3754	   The brightest through these parted hills hath forked
  3755	   His lightnings, as if he did understand
  3756	   That in such gaps as desolation worked,
  3757	There the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.
  3758	
  3759	XCVI.
  3760	
  3761	   Sky, mountains, river, winds, lake, lightnings! ye,
  3762	   With night, and clouds, and thunder, and a soul
  3763	   To make these felt and feeling, well may be
  3764	   Things that have made me watchful; the far roll
  3765	   Of your departing voices, is the knoll
  3766	   Of what in me is sleepless,--if I rest.
  3767	   But where of ye, O tempests! is the goal?
  3768	   Are ye like those within the human breast?
  3769	Or do ye find at length, like eagles, some high nest?
  3770	
  3771	XCVII.
  3772	
  3773	   Could I embody and unbosom now
  3774	   That which is most within me,--could I wreak
  3775	   My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw
  3776	   Soul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,
  3777	   All that I would have sought, and all I seek,
  3778	   Bear, know, feel, and yet breathe--into one word,
  3779	   And that one word were lightning, I would speak;
  3780	   But as it is, I live and die unheard,
  3781	With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.
  3782	
  3783	XCVIII.
  3784	
  3785	   The morn is up again, the dewy morn,
  3786	   With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom,
  3787	   Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn,
  3788	   And living as if earth contained no tomb,--
  3789	   And glowing into day:  we may resume
  3790	   The march of our existence:  and thus I,
  3791	   Still on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room
  3792	   And food for meditation, nor pass by
  3793	Much, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.
  3794	
  3795	XCIX.
  3796	
  3797	   Clarens! sweet Clarens! birthplace of deep Love!
  3798	   Thine air is the young breath of passionate thought;
  3799	   Thy trees take root in love; the snows above
  3800	   The very glaciers have his colours caught,
  3801	   And sunset into rose-hues sees them wrought
  3802	   By rays which sleep there lovingly:  the rocks,
  3803	   The permanent crags, tell here of Love, who sought
  3804	   In them a refuge from the worldly shocks,
  3805	Which stir and sting the soul with hope that woos, then mocks.
  3806	
  3807	C.
  3808	
  3809	   Clarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod,--
  3810	   Undying Love's, who here ascends a throne
  3811	   To which the steps are mountains; where the god
  3812	   Is a pervading life and light,--so shown
  3813	   Not on those summits solely, nor alone
  3814	   In the still cave and forest; o'er the flower
  3815	   His eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,
  3816	   His soft and summer breath, whose tender power
  3817	Passes the strength of storms in their most desolate hour.
  3818	
  3819	CI.
  3820	
  3821	   All things are here of HIM; from the black pines,
  3822	   Which are his shade on high, and the loud roar
  3823	   Of torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines
  3824	   Which slope his green path downward to the shore,
  3825	   Where the bowed waters meet him, and adore,
  3826	   Kissing his feet with murmurs; and the wood,
  3827	   The covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,
  3828	   But light leaves, young as joy, stands where it stood,
  3829	Offering to him, and his, a populous solitude.
  3830	
  3831	CII.
  3832	
  3833	   A populous solitude of bees and birds,
  3834	   And fairy-formed and many coloured things,
  3835	   Who worship him with notes more sweet than words,
  3836	   And innocently open their glad wings,
  3837	   Fearless and full of life:  the gush of springs,
  3838	   And fall of lofty fountains, and the bend
  3839	   Of stirring branches, and the bud which brings
  3840	   The swiftest thought of beauty, here extend,
  3841	Mingling, and made by Love, unto one mighty end.
  3842	
  3843	CIII.
  3844	
  3845	   He who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,
  3846	   And make his heart a spirit:  he who knows
  3847	   That tender mystery, will love the more,
  3848	   For this is Love's recess, where vain men's woes,
  3849	   And the world's waste, have driven him far from those,
  3850	   For 'tis his nature to advance or die;
  3851	   He stands not still, but or decays, or grows
  3852	   Into a boundless blessing, which may vie
  3853	With the immortal lights, in its eternity!
  3854	
  3855	CIV.
  3856	
  3857	   'Twas not for fiction chose Rousseau this spot,
  3858	   Peopling it with affections; but he found
  3859	   It was the scene which passion must allot
  3860	   To the mind's purified beings; 'twas the ground
  3861	   Where early Love his Psyche's zone unbound,
  3862	   And hallowed it with loveliness:  'tis lone,
  3863	   And wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,
  3864	   And sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone
  3865	Hath spread himself a couch, the Alps have reared a throne.
  3866	
  3867	CV.
  3868	
  3869	   Lausanne! and Ferney! ye have been the abodes
  3870	   Of names which unto you bequeathed a name;
  3871	   Mortals, who sought and found, by dangerous roads,
  3872	   A path to perpetuity of fame:
  3873	   They were gigantic minds, and their steep aim
  3874	   Was, Titan-like, on daring doubts to pile
  3875	   Thoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame
  3876	   Of Heaven, again assailed, if Heaven the while
  3877	On man and man's research could deign do more than smile.
  3878	
  3879	CVI.
  3880	
  3881	   The one was fire and fickleness, a child
  3882	   Most mutable in wishes, but in mind
  3883	   A wit as various,--gay, grave, sage, or wild,--
  3884	   Historian, bard, philosopher combined:
  3885	   He multiplied himself among mankind,
  3886	   The Proteus of their talents:  But his own
  3887	   Breathed most in ridicule,--which, as the wind,
  3888	   Blew where it listed, laying all things prone,--
  3889	Now to o'erthrow a fool, and now to shake a throne.
  3890	
  3891	CVII.
  3892	
  3893	   The other, deep and slow, exhausting thought,
  3894	   And hiving wisdom with each studious year,
  3895	   In meditation dwelt, with learning wrought,
  3896	   And shaped his weapon with an edge severe,
  3897	   Sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer;
  3898	   The lord of irony,--that master spell,
  3899	   Which stung his foes to wrath, which grew from fear,
  3900	   And doomed him to the zealot's ready hell,
  3901	Which answers to all doubts so eloquently well.
  3902	
  3903	CVIII.
  3904	
  3905	   Yet, peace be with their ashes,--for by them,
  3906	   If merited, the penalty is paid;
  3907	   It is not ours to judge, far less condemn;
  3908	   The hour must come when such things shall be made
  3909	   Known unto all,--or hope and dread allayed
  3910	   By slumber on one pillow, in the dust,
  3911	   Which, thus much we are sure, must lie decayed;
  3912	   And when it shall revive, as is our trust,
  3913	'Twill be to be forgiven, or suffer what is just.
  3914	
  3915	CIX.
  3916	
  3917	   But let me quit man's works, again to read
  3918	   His Maker's spread around me, and suspend
  3919	   This page, which from my reveries I feed,
  3920	   Until it seems prolonging without end.
  3921	   The clouds above me to the white Alps tend,
  3922	   And I must pierce them, and survey whate'er
  3923	   May be permitted, as my steps I bend
  3924	   To their most great and growing region, where
  3925	The earth to her embrace compels the powers of air.
  3926	
  3927	CX.
  3928	
  3929	   Italia! too, Italia! looking on thee
  3930	   Full flashes on the soul the light of ages,
  3931	   Since the fierce Carthaginian almost won thee,
  3932	   To the last halo of the chiefs and sages
  3933	   Who glorify thy consecrated pages;
  3934	   Thou wert the throne and grave of empires; still,
  3935	   The fount at which the panting mind assuages
  3936	   Her thirst of knowledge, quaffing there her fill,
  3937	Flows from the eternal source of Rome's imperial hill.
  3938	
  3939	CXI.
  3940	
  3941	   Thus far have I proceeded in a theme
  3942	   Renewed with no kind auspices:--to feel
  3943	   We are not what we have been, and to deem
  3944	   We are not what we should be, and to steel
  3945	   The heart against itself; and to conceal,
  3946	   With a proud caution, love or hate, or aught,--
  3947	   Passion or feeling, purpose, grief, or zeal,--
  3948	   Which is the tyrant spirit of our thought,
  3949	Is a stern task of soul:--No matter,--it is taught.
  3950	
  3951	CXII.
  3952	
  3953	   And for these words, thus woven into song,
  3954	   It may be that they are a harmless wile,--
  3955	   The colouring of the scenes which fleet along,
  3956	   Which I would seize, in passing, to beguile
  3957	   My breast, or that of others, for a while.
  3958	   Fame is the thirst of youth,--but I am not
  3959	   So young as to regard men's frown or smile
  3960	   As loss or guerdon of a glorious lot;
  3961	I stood and stand alone,--remembered or forgot.
  3962	
  3963	CXIII.
  3964	
  3965	   I have not loved the world, nor the world me;
  3966	   I have not flattered its rank breath, nor bowed
  3967	   To its idolatries a patient knee,--
  3968	   Nor coined my cheek to smiles, nor cried aloud
  3969	   In worship of an echo; in the crowd
  3970	   They could not deem me one of such; I stood
  3971	   Among them, but not of them; in a shroud
  3972	   Of thoughts which were not their thoughts, and still could,
  3973	Had I not filed my mind, which thus itself subdued.
  3974	
  3975	CXIV.
  3976	
  3977	   I have not loved the world, nor the world me,--
  3978	   But let us part fair foes; I do believe,
  3979	   Though I have found them not, that there may be
  3980	   Words which are things,--hopes which will not deceive,
  3981	   And virtues which are merciful, nor weave
  3982	   Snares for the falling:  I would also deem
  3983	   O'er others' griefs that some sincerely grieve;
  3984	   That two, or one, are almost what they seem,--
  3985	That goodness is no name, and happiness no dream.
  3986	
  3987	CXV.
  3988	
  3989	   My daughter! with thy name this song begun--
  3990	   My daughter! with thy name this much shall end--
  3991	   I see thee not, I hear thee not,--but none
  3992	   Can be so wrapt in thee; thou art the friend
  3993	   To whom the shadows of far years extend:
  3994	   Albeit my brow thou never shouldst behold,
  3995	   My voice shall with thy future visions blend,
  3996	   And reach into thy heart, when mine is cold,--
  3997	A token and a tone, even from thy father's mould.
  3998	
  3999	CXVI.
  4000	
  4001	   To aid thy mind's development,--to watch
  4002	   Thy dawn of little joys,--to sit and see
  4003	   Almost thy very growth,--to view thee catch
  4004	   Knowledge of objects, wonders yet to thee!
  4005	   To hold thee lightly on a gentle knee,
  4006	   And print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss,--
  4007	   This, it should seem, was not reserved for me
  4008	   Yet this was in my nature:--As it is,
  4009	I know not what is there, yet something like to this.
  4010	
  4011	CXVII.
  4012	
  4013	   Yet, though dull Hate as duty should be taught,
  4014	   I know that thou wilt love me; though my name
  4015	   Should be shut from thee, as a spell still fraught
  4016	   With desolation, and a broken claim:
  4017	   Though the grave closed between us,--'twere the same,
  4018	   I know that thou wilt love me:  though to drain
  4019	   MY blood from out thy being were an aim,
  4020	   And an attainment,--all would be in vain,--
  4021	Still thou wouldst love me, still that more than life retain.
  4022	
  4023	CXVIII.
  4024	
  4025	   The child of love,--though born in bitterness,
  4026	   And nurtured in convulsion.  Of thy sire
  4027	   These were the elements, and thine no less.
  4028	   As yet such are around thee; but thy fire
  4029	   Shall be more tempered, and thy hope far higher.
  4030	   Sweet be thy cradled slumbers!  O'er the sea,
  4031	   And from the mountains where I now respire,
  4032	   Fain would I waft such blessing upon thee,
  4033	As, with a sigh, I deem thou mightst have been to me!
  4034	
  4035	
  4036	
  4037	
  4038	CANTO THE FOURTH.
  4039	
  4040	
  4041	
  4042	I.
  4043	
  4044	   I stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;
  4045	   A palace and a prison on each hand:
  4046	   I saw from out the wave her structures rise
  4047	   As from the stroke of the enchanter's wand:
  4048	   A thousand years their cloudy wings expand
  4049	   Around me, and a dying glory smiles
  4050	   O'er the far times when many a subject land
  4051	   Looked to the winged Lion's marble piles,
  4052	Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles!
  4053	
  4054	II.
  4055	
  4056	   She looks a sea Cybele, fresh from ocean,
  4057	   Rising with her tiara of proud towers
  4058	   At airy distance, with majestic motion,
  4059	   A ruler of the waters and their powers:
  4060	   And such she was; her daughters had their dowers
  4061	   From spoils of nations, and the exhaustless East
  4062	   Poured in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.
  4063	   In purple was she robed, and of her feast
  4064	Monarchs partook, and deemed their dignity increased.
  4065	
  4066	III.
  4067	
  4068	   In Venice, Tasso's echoes are no more,
  4069	   And silent rows the songless gondolier;
  4070	   Her palaces are crumbling to the shore,
  4071	   And music meets not always now the ear:
  4072	   Those days are gone--but beauty still is here.
  4073	   States fall, arts fade--but Nature doth not die,
  4074	   Nor yet forget how Venice once was dear,
  4075	   The pleasant place of all festivity,
  4076	The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy!
  4077	
  4078	IV.
  4079	
  4080	   But unto us she hath a spell beyond
  4081	   Her name in story, and her long array
  4082	   Of mighty shadows, whose dim forms despond
  4083	   Above the dogeless city's vanished sway;
  4084	   Ours is a trophy which will not decay
  4085	   With the Rialto; Shylock and the Moor,
  4086	   And Pierre, cannot be swept or worn away--
  4087	   The keystones of the arch! though all were o'er,
  4088	For us repeopled were the solitary shore.
  4089	
  4090	V.
  4091	
  4092	   The beings of the mind are not of clay;
  4093	   Essentially immortal, they create
  4094	   And multiply in us a brighter ray
  4095	   And more beloved existence:  that which Fate
  4096	   Prohibits to dull life, in this our state
  4097	   Of mortal bondage, by these spirits supplied,
  4098	   First exiles, then replaces what we hate;
  4099	   Watering the heart whose early flowers have died,
  4100	And with a fresher growth replenishing the void.
  4101	
  4102	VI.
  4103	
  4104	   Such is the refuge of our youth and age,
  4105	   The first from Hope, the last from Vacancy;
  4106	   And this worn feeling peoples many a page,
  4107	   And, may be, that which grows beneath mine eye:
  4108	   Yet there are things whose strong reality
  4109	   Outshines our fairy-land; in shape and hues
  4110	   More beautiful than our fantastic sky,
  4111	   And the strange constellations which the Muse
  4112	O'er her wild universe is skilful to diffuse:
  4113	
  4114	VII.
  4115	
  4116	   I saw or dreamed of such,--but let them go--
  4117	   They came like truth, and disappeared like dreams;
  4118	   And whatsoe'er they were--are now but so;
  4119	   I could replace them if I would:  still teems
  4120	   My mind with many a form which aptly seems
  4121	   Such as I sought for, and at moments found;
  4122	   Let these too go--for waking reason deems
  4123	   Such overweening phantasies unsound,
  4124	And other voices speak, and other sights surround.
  4125	
  4126	VIII.
  4127	
  4128	   I've taught me other tongues, and in strange eyes
  4129	   Have made me not a stranger; to the mind
  4130	   Which is itself, no changes bring surprise;
  4131	   Nor is it harsh to make, nor hard to find
  4132	   A country with--ay, or without mankind;
  4133	   Yet was I born where men are proud to be,
  4134	   Not without cause; and should I leave behind
  4135	   The inviolate island of the sage and free,
  4136	And seek me out a home by a remoter sea,
  4137	
  4138	IX.
  4139	
  4140	   Perhaps I loved it well:  and should I lay
  4141	   My ashes in a soil which is not mine,
  4142	   My spirit shall resume it--if we may
  4143	   Unbodied choose a sanctuary.  I twine
  4144	   My hopes of being remembered in my line
  4145	   With my land's language:  if too fond and far
  4146	   These aspirations in their scope incline,--
  4147	   If my fame should be, as my fortunes are,
  4148	Of hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion bar.
  4149	
  4150	X.
  4151	
  4152	   My name from out the temple where the dead
  4153	   Are honoured by the nations--let it be--
  4154	   And light the laurels on a loftier head!
  4155	   And be the Spartan's epitaph on me--
  4156	   'Sparta hath many a worthier son than he.'
  4157	   Meantime I seek no sympathies, nor need;
  4158	   The thorns which I have reaped are of the tree
  4159	   I planted,--they have torn me, and I bleed:
  4160	I should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.
  4161	
  4162	XI.
  4163	
  4164	   The spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord;
  4165	   And, annual marriage now no more renewed,
  4166	   The Bucentaur lies rotting unrestored,
  4167	   Neglected garment of her widowhood!
  4168	   St. Mark yet sees his lion where he stood
  4169	   Stand, but in mockery of his withered power,
  4170	   Over the proud place where an Emperor sued,
  4171	   And monarchs gazed and envied in the hour
  4172	When Venice was a queen with an unequalled dower.
  4173	
  4174	XII.
  4175	
  4176	   The Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns--
  4177	   An Emperor tramples where an Emperor knelt;
  4178	   Kingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains
  4179	   Clank over sceptred cities; nations melt
  4180	   From power's high pinnacle, when they have felt
  4181	   The sunshine for a while, and downward go
  4182	   Like lauwine loosened from the mountain's belt:
  4183	   Oh for one hour of blind old Dandolo!
  4184	The octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.
  4185	
  4186	XIII.
  4187	
  4188	   Before St. Mark still glow his steeds of brass,
  4189	   Their gilded collars glittering in the sun;
  4190	   But is not Doria's menace come to pass?
  4191	   Are they not BRIDLED?--Venice, lost and won,
  4192	   Her thirteen hundred years of freedom done,
  4193	   Sinks, like a seaweed, into whence she rose!
  4194	   Better be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun,
  4195	   Even in Destruction's depth, her foreign foes,
  4196	From whom submission wrings an infamous repose.
  4197	
  4198	XIV.
  4199	
  4200	   In youth she was all glory,--a new Tyre,--
  4201	   Her very byword sprung from victory,
  4202	   The 'Planter of the Lion,' which through fire
  4203	   And blood she bore o'er subject earth and sea;
  4204	   Though making many slaves, herself still free
  4205	   And Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite:
  4206	   Witness Troy's rival, Candia!  Vouch it, ye
  4207	   Immortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight!
  4208	For ye are names no time nor tyranny can blight.
  4209	
  4210	XV.
  4211	
  4212	   Statues of glass--all shivered--the long file
  4213	   Of her dead doges are declined to dust;
  4214	   But where they dwelt, the vast and sumptuous pile
  4215	   Bespeaks the pageant of their splendid trust;
  4216	   Their sceptre broken, and their sword in rust,
  4217	   Have yielded to the stranger:  empty halls,
  4218	   Thin streets, and foreign aspects, such as must
  4219	   Too oft remind her who and what enthrals,
  4220	Have flung a desolate cloud o'er Venice' lovely walls.
  4221	
  4222	XVI.
  4223	
  4224	   When Athens' armies fell at Syracuse,
  4225	   And fettered thousands bore the yoke of war,
  4226	   Redemption rose up in the Attic Muse,
  4227	   Her voice their only ransom from afar:
  4228	   See! as they chant the tragic hymn, the car
  4229	   Of the o'ermastered victor stops, the reins
  4230	   Fall from his hands--his idle scimitar
  4231	   Starts from its belt--he rends his captive's chains,
  4232	And bids him thank the bard for freedom and his strains.
  4233	
  4234	XVII.
  4235	
  4236	   Thus, Venice, if no stronger claim were thine,
  4237	   Were all thy proud historic deeds forgot,
  4238	   Thy choral memory of the bard divine,
  4239	   Thy love of Tasso, should have cut the knot
  4240	   Which ties thee to thy tyrants; and thy lot
  4241	   Is shameful to the nations,--most of all,
  4242	   Albion! to thee:  the Ocean Queen should not
  4243	   Abandon Ocean's children; in the fall
  4244	Of Venice think of thine, despite thy watery wall.
  4245	
  4246	XVIII.
  4247	
  4248	   I loved her from my boyhood:  she to me
  4249	   Was as a fairy city of the heart,
  4250	   Rising like water-columns from the sea,
  4251	   Of joy the sojourn, and of wealth the mart
  4252	   And Otway, Radcliffe, Schiller, Shakspeare's art,
  4253	   Had stamped her image in me, and e'en so,
  4254	   Although I found her thus, we did not part,
  4255	   Perchance e'en dearer in her day of woe,
  4256	Than when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.
  4257	
  4258	XIX.
  4259	
  4260	   I can repeople with the past--and of
  4261	   The present there is still for eye and thought,
  4262	   And meditation chastened down, enough;
  4263	   And more, it may be, than I hoped or sought;
  4264	   And of the happiest moments which were wrought
  4265	   Within the web of my existence, some
  4266	   From thee, fair Venice! have their colours caught:
  4267	   There are some feelings Time cannot benumb,
  4268	Nor torture shake, or mine would now be cold and dumb.
  4269	
  4270	XX.
  4271	
  4272	   But from their nature will the tannen grow
  4273	   Loftiest on loftiest and least sheltered rocks,
  4274	   Rooted in barrenness, where nought below
  4275	   Of soil supports them 'gainst the Alpine shocks
  4276	   Of eddying storms; yet springs the trunk, and mocks
  4277	   The howling tempest, till its height and frame
  4278	   Are worthy of the mountains from whose blocks
  4279	   Of bleak, grey granite, into life it came,
  4280	And grew a giant tree;--the mind may grow the same.
  4281	
  4282	XXI.
  4283	
  4284	   Existence may be borne, and the deep root
  4285	   Of life and sufferance make its firm abode
  4286	   In bare and desolate bosoms:  mute
  4287	   The camel labours with the heaviest load,
  4288	   And the wolf dies in silence.  Not bestowed
  4289	   In vain should such examples be; if they,
  4290	   Things of ignoble or of savage mood,
  4291	   Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay
  4292	May temper it to bear,--it is but for a day.
  4293	
  4294	XXII.
  4295	
  4296	   All suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed,
  4297	   Even by the sufferer; and, in each event,
  4298	   Ends:--Some, with hope replenished and rebuoyed,
  4299	   Return to whence they came--with like intent,
  4300	   And weave their web again; some, bowed and bent,
  4301	   Wax grey and ghastly, withering ere their time,
  4302	   And perish with the reed on which they leant;
  4303	   Some seek devotion, toil, war, good or crime,
  4304	According as their souls were formed to sink or climb.
  4305	
  4306	XXIII.
  4307	
  4308	   But ever and anon of griefs subdued
  4309	   There comes a token like a scorpion's sting,
  4310	   Scarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued;
  4311	   And slight withal may be the things which bring
  4312	   Back on the heart the weight which it would fling
  4313	   Aside for ever:  it may be a sound--
  4314	   A tone of music--summer's eve--or spring--
  4315	   A flower--the wind--the ocean--which shall wound,
  4316	Striking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound.
  4317	
  4318	XXIV.
  4319	
  4320	   And how and why we know not, nor can trace
  4321	   Home to its cloud this lightning of the mind,
  4322	   But feel the shock renewed, nor can efface
  4323	   The blight and blackening which it leaves behind,
  4324	   Which out of things familiar, undesigned,
  4325	   When least we deem of such, calls up to view
  4326	   The spectres whom no exorcism can bind,--
  4327	   The cold--the changed--perchance the dead--anew,
  4328	The mourned, the loved, the lost--too many!--yet how few!
  4329	
  4330	XXV.
  4331	
  4332	   But my soul wanders; I demand it back
  4333	   To meditate amongst decay, and stand
  4334	   A ruin amidst ruins; there to track
  4335	   Fall'n states and buried greatness, o'er a land
  4336	   Which WAS the mightiest in its old command,
  4337	   And IS the loveliest, and must ever be
  4338	   The master-mould of Nature's heavenly hand,
  4339	   Wherein were cast the heroic and the free,
  4340	The beautiful, the brave--the lords of earth and sea.
  4341	
  4342	XXVI.
  4343	
  4344	   The commonwealth of kings, the men of Rome!
  4345	   And even since, and now, fair Italy!
  4346	   Thou art the garden of the world, the home
  4347	   Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree;
  4348	   Even in thy desert, what is like to thee?
  4349	   Thy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste
  4350	   More rich than other climes' fertility;
  4351	   Thy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced
  4352	With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.
  4353	
  4354	XXVII.
  4355	
  4356	   The moon is up, and yet it is not night--
  4357	   Sunset divides the sky with her--a sea
  4358	   Of glory streams along the Alpine height
  4359	   Of blue Friuli's mountains; Heaven is free
  4360	   From clouds, but of all colours seems to be--
  4361	   Melted to one vast Iris of the West,
  4362	   Where the day joins the past eternity;
  4363	   While, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest
  4364	Floats through the azure air--an island of the blest!
  4365	
  4366	XXVIII.
  4367	
  4368	   A single star is at her side, and reigns
  4369	   With her o'er half the lovely heaven; but still
  4370	   Yon sunny sea heaves brightly, and remains
  4371	   Rolled o'er the peak of the far Rhaetian hill,
  4372	   As Day and Night contending were, until
  4373	   Nature reclaimed her order:--gently flows
  4374	   The deep-dyed Brenta, where their hues instil
  4375	   The odorous purple of a new-born rose,
  4376	Which streams upon her stream, and glassed within it glows,
  4377	
  4378	XXIX.
  4379	
  4380	   Filled with the face of heaven, which, from afar,
  4381	   Comes down upon the waters; all its hues,
  4382	   From the rich sunset to the rising star,
  4383	   Their magical variety diffuse:
  4384	   And now they change; a paler shadow strews
  4385	   Its mantle o'er the mountains; parting day
  4386	   Dies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues
  4387	   With a new colour as it gasps away,
  4388	The last still loveliest, till--'tis gone--and all is grey.
  4389	
  4390	XXX.
  4391	
  4392	   There is a tomb in Arqua;--reared in air,
  4393	   Pillared in their sarcophagus, repose
  4394	   The bones of Laura's lover:  here repair
  4395	   Many familiar with his well-sung woes,
  4396	   The pilgrims of his genius.  He arose
  4397	   To raise a language, and his land reclaim
  4398	   From the dull yoke of her barbaric foes:
  4399	   Watering the tree which bears his lady's name
  4400	With his melodious tears, he gave himself to fame.
  4401	
  4402	XXXI.
  4403	
  4404	   They keep his dust in Arqua, where he died;
  4405	   The mountain-village where his latter days
  4406	   Went down the vale of years; and 'tis their pride--
  4407	   An honest pride--and let it be their praise,
  4408	   To offer to the passing stranger's gaze
  4409	   His mansion and his sepulchre; both plain
  4410	   And venerably simple, such as raise
  4411	   A feeling more accordant with his strain,
  4412	Than if a pyramid formed his monumental fane.
  4413	
  4414	XXXII.
  4415	
  4416	   And the soft quiet hamlet where he dwelt
  4417	   Is one of that complexion which seems made
  4418	   For those who their mortality have felt,
  4419	   And sought a refuge from their hopes decayed
  4420	   In the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade,
  4421	   Which shows a distant prospect far away
  4422	   Of busy cities, now in vain displayed,
  4423	   For they can lure no further; and the ray
  4424	Of a bright sun can make sufficient holiday.
  4425	
  4426	XXXIII.
  4427	
  4428	   Developing the mountains, leaves, and flowers
  4429	   And shining in the brawling brook, where-by,
  4430	   Clear as its current, glide the sauntering hours
  4431	   With a calm languor, which, though to the eye
  4432	   Idlesse it seem, hath its morality,
  4433	   If from society we learn to live,
  4434	   'Tis solitude should teach us how to die;
  4435	   It hath no flatterers; vanity can give
  4436	No hollow aid; alone--man with his God must strive:
  4437	
  4438	XXXIV.
  4439	
  4440	   Or, it may be, with demons, who impair
  4441	   The strength of better thoughts, and seek their prey
  4442	   In melancholy bosoms, such as were
  4443	   Of moody texture from their earliest day,
  4444	   And loved to dwell in darkness and dismay,
  4445	   Deeming themselves predestined to a doom
  4446	   Which is not of the pangs that pass away;
  4447	   Making the sun like blood, the earth a tomb,
  4448	The tomb a hell, and hell itself a murkier gloom.
  4449	
  4450	XXXV.
  4451	
  4452	   Ferrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets,
  4453	   Whose symmetry was not for solitude,
  4454	   There seems as 'twere a curse upon the seat's
  4455	   Of former sovereigns, and the antique brood
  4456	   Of Este, which for many an age made good
  4457	   Its strength within thy walls, and was of yore
  4458	   Patron or tyrant, as the changing mood
  4459	   Of petty power impelled, of those who wore
  4460	The wreath which Dante's brow alone had worn before.
  4461	
  4462	XXXVI.
  4463	
  4464	   And Tasso is their glory and their shame.
  4465	   Hark to his strain! and then survey his cell!
  4466	   And see how dearly earned Torquato's fame,
  4467	   And where Alfonso bade his poet dwell.
  4468	   The miserable despot could not quell
  4469	   The insulted mind he sought to quench, and blend
  4470	   With the surrounding maniacs, in the hell
  4471	   Where he had plunged it.  Glory without end
  4472	Scattered the clouds away--and on that name attend
  4473	
  4474	XXXVII.
  4475	
  4476	   The tears and praises of all time, while thine
  4477	   Would rot in its oblivion--in the sink
  4478	   Of worthless dust, which from thy boasted line
  4479	   Is shaken into nothing; but the link
  4480	   Thou formest in his fortunes bids us think
  4481	   Of thy poor malice, naming thee with scorn--
  4482	   Alfonso! how thy ducal pageants shrink
  4483	   From thee! if in another station born,
  4484	Scarce fit to be the slave of him thou mad'st to mourn:
  4485	
  4486	XXXVIII.
  4487	
  4488	   THOU! formed to eat, and be despised, and die,
  4489	   Even as the beasts that perish, save that thou
  4490	   Hadst a more splendid trough, and wider sty:
  4491	   HE! with a glory round his furrowed brow,
  4492	   Which emanated then, and dazzles now
  4493	   In face of all his foes, the Cruscan quire,
  4494	   And Boileau, whose rash envy could allow
  4495	   No strain which shamed his country's creaking lyre,
  4496	That whetstone of the teeth--monotony in wire!
  4497	
  4498	XXXIX.
  4499	
  4500	   Peace to Torquato's injured shade! 'twas his
  4501	   In life and death to be the mark where Wrong
  4502	   Aimed with their poisoned arrows--but to miss.
  4503	   Oh, victor unsurpassed in modern song!
  4504	   Each year brings forth its millions; but how long
  4505	   The tide of generations shall roll on,
  4506	   And not the whole combined and countless throng
  4507	   Compose a mind like thine?  Though all in one
  4508	Condensed their scattered rays, they would not form a sun.
  4509	
  4510	XL.
  4511	
  4512	   Great as thou art, yet paralleled by those
  4513	   Thy countrymen, before thee born to shine,
  4514	   The bards of Hell and Chivalry:  first rose
  4515	   The Tuscan father's comedy divine;
  4516	   Then, not unequal to the Florentine,
  4517	   The Southern Scott, the minstrel who called forth
  4518	   A new creation with his magic line,
  4519	   And, like the Ariosto of the North,
  4520	Sang ladye-love and war, romance and knightly worth.
  4521	
  4522	XLI.
  4523	
  4524	   The lightning rent from Ariosto's bust
  4525	   The iron crown of laurel's mimicked leaves;
  4526	   Nor was the ominous element unjust,
  4527	   For the true laurel-wreath which Glory weaves
  4528	   Is of the tree no bolt of thunder cleaves,
  4529	   And the false semblance but disgraced his brow;
  4530	   Yet still, if fondly Superstition grieves,
  4531	   Know that the lightning sanctifies below
  4532	Whate'er it strikes;--yon head is doubly sacred now.
  4533	
  4534	XLII.
  4535	
  4536	   Italia!  O Italia! thou who hast
  4537	   The fatal gift of beauty, which became
  4538	   A funeral dower of present woes and past,
  4539	   On thy sweet brow is sorrow ploughed by shame,
  4540	   And annals graved in characters of flame.
  4541	   Oh God! that thou wert in thy nakedness
  4542	   Less lovely or more powerful, and couldst claim
  4543	   Thy right, and awe the robbers back, who press
  4544	To shed thy blood, and drink the tears of thy distress;
  4545	
  4546	XLIII.
  4547	
  4548	   Then mightst thou more appal; or, less desired,
  4549	   Be homely and be peaceful, undeplored
  4550	   For thy destructive charms; then, still untired,
  4551	   Would not be seen the armed torrents poured
  4552	   Down the deep Alps; nor would the hostile horde
  4553	   Of many-nationed spoilers from the Po
  4554	   Quaff blood and water; nor the stranger's sword
  4555	   Be thy sad weapon of defence, and so,
  4556	Victor or vanquished, thou the slave of friend or foe.
  4557	
  4558	XLIV.
  4559	
  4560	   Wandering in youth, I traced the path of him,
  4561	   The Roman friend of Rome's least mortal mind,
  4562	   The friend of Tully:  as my bark did skim
  4563	   The bright blue waters with a fanning wind,
  4564	   Came Megara before me, and behind
  4565	   AEgina lay, Piraeus on the right,
  4566	   And Corinth on the left; I lay reclined
  4567	   Along the prow, and saw all these unite
  4568	In ruin, even as he had seen the desolate sight;
  4569	
  4570	XLV.
  4571	
  4572	   For time hath not rebuilt them, but upreared
  4573	   Barbaric dwellings on their shattered site,
  4574	   Which only make more mourned and more endeared
  4575	   The few last rays of their far-scattered light,
  4576	   And the crushed relics of their vanished might.
  4577	   The Roman saw these tombs in his own age,
  4578	   These sepulchres of cities, which excite
  4579	   Sad wonder, and his yet surviving page
  4580	The moral lesson bears, drawn from such pilgrimage.
  4581	
  4582	XLVI.
  4583	
  4584	   That page is now before me, and on mine
  4585	   HIS country's ruin added to the mass
  4586	   Of perished states he mourned in their decline,
  4587	   And I in desolation:  all that WAS
  4588	   Of then destruction IS; and now, alas!
  4589	   Rome--Rome imperial, bows her to the storm,
  4590	   In the same dust and blackness, and we pass
  4591	   The skeleton of her Titanic form,
  4592	Wrecks of another world, whose ashes still are warm.
  4593	
  4594	XLVII.
  4595	
  4596	   Yet, Italy! through every other land
  4597	   Thy wrongs should ring, and shall, from side to side;
  4598	   Mother of Arts! as once of Arms; thy hand
  4599	   Was then our Guardian, and is still our guide;
  4600	   Parent of our religion! whom the wide
  4601	   Nations have knelt to for the keys of heaven!
  4602	   Europe, repentant of her parricide,
  4603	   Shall yet redeem thee, and, all backward driven,
  4604	Roll the barbarian tide, and sue to be forgiven.
  4605	
  4606	XLVIII.
  4607	
  4608	   But Arno wins us to the fair white walls,
  4609	   Where the Etrurian Athens claims and keeps
  4610	   A softer feeling for her fairy halls.
  4611	   Girt by her theatre of hills, she reaps
  4612	   Her corn, and wine, and oil, and Plenty leaps
  4613	   To laughing life, with her redundant horn.
  4614	   Along the banks where smiling Arno sweeps,
  4615	   Was modern Luxury of Commerce born,
  4616	And buried Learning rose, redeemed to a new morn.
  4617	
  4618	XLIX.
  4619	
  4620	   There, too, the goddess loves in stone, and fills
  4621	   The air around with beauty; we inhale
  4622	   The ambrosial aspect, which, beheld, instils
  4623	   Part of its immortality; the veil
  4624	   Of heaven is half undrawn; within the pale
  4625	   We stand, and in that form and face behold
  4626	   What Mind can make, when Nature's self would fail;
  4627	   And to the fond idolaters of old
  4628	Envy the innate flash which such a soul could mould:
  4629	
  4630	L.
  4631	
  4632	   We gaze and turn away, and know not where,
  4633	   Dazzled and drunk with beauty, till the heart
  4634	   Reels with its fulness; there--for ever there--
  4635	   Chained to the chariot of triumphal Art,
  4636	   We stand as captives, and would not depart.
  4637	   Away!--there need no words, nor terms precise,
  4638	   The paltry jargon of the marble mart,
  4639	   Where Pedantry gulls Folly--we have eyes:
  4640	Blood, pulse, and breast, confirm the Dardan Shepherd's prize.
  4641	
  4642	LI.
  4643	
  4644	   Appearedst thou not to Paris in this guise?
  4645	   Or to more deeply blest Anchises? or,
  4646	   In all thy perfect goddess-ship, when lies
  4647	   Before thee thy own vanquished Lord of War?
  4648	   And gazing in thy face as toward a star,
  4649	   Laid on thy lap, his eyes to thee upturn,
  4650	   Feeding on thy sweet cheek! while thy lips are
  4651	   With lava kisses melting while they burn,
  4652	Showered on his eyelids, brow, and mouth, as from an urn!
  4653	
  4654	LII.
  4655	
  4656	   Glowing, and circumfused in speechless love,
  4657	   Their full divinity inadequate
  4658	   That feeling to express, or to improve,
  4659	   The gods become as mortals, and man's fate
  4660	   Has moments like their brightest! but the weight
  4661	   Of earth recoils upon us;--let it go!
  4662	   We can recall such visions, and create
  4663	   From what has been, or might be, things which grow,
  4664	Into thy statue's form, and look like gods below.
  4665	
  4666	LIII.
  4667	
  4668	   I leave to learned fingers, and wise hands,
  4669	   The artist and his ape, to teach and tell
  4670	   How well his connoisseurship understands
  4671	   The graceful bend, and the voluptuous swell:
  4672	   Let these describe the undescribable:
  4673	   I would not their vile breath should crisp the stream
  4674	   Wherein that image shall for ever dwell;
  4675	   The unruffled mirror of the loveliest dream
  4676	That ever left the sky on the deep soul to beam.
  4677	
  4678	LIV.
  4679	
  4680	   In Santa Croce's holy precincts lie
  4681	   Ashes which make it holier, dust which is
  4682	   E'en in itself an immortality,
  4683	   Though there were nothing save the past, and this
  4684	   The particle of those sublimities
  4685	   Which have relapsed to chaos:--here repose
  4686	   Angelo's, Alfieri's bones, and his,
  4687	   The starry Galileo, with his woes;
  4688	Here Machiavelli's earth returned to whence it rose.
  4689	
  4690	LV.
  4691	
  4692	   These are four minds, which, like the elements,
  4693	   Might furnish forth creation:--Italy!
  4694	   Time, which hath wronged thee with ten thousand rents
  4695	   Of thine imperial garment, shall deny,
  4696	   And hath denied, to every other sky,
  4697	   Spirits which soar from ruin:--thy decay
  4698	   Is still impregnate with divinity,
  4699	   Which gilds it with revivifying ray;
  4700	Such as the great of yore, Canova is to-day.
  4701	
  4702	LVI.
  4703	
  4704	   But where repose the all Etruscan three--
  4705	   Dante, and Petrarch, and, scarce less than they,
  4706	   The Bard of Prose, creative spirit! he
  4707	   Of the Hundred Tales of love--where did they lay
  4708	   Their bones, distinguished from our common clay
  4709	   In death as life?  Are they resolved to dust,
  4710	   And have their country's marbles nought to say?
  4711	   Could not her quarries furnish forth one bust?
  4712	Did they not to her breast their filial earth entrust?
  4713	
  4714	LVII.
  4715	
  4716	   Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar,
  4717	   Like Scipio, buried by the upbraiding shore;
  4718	   Thy factions, in their worse than civil war,
  4719	   Proscribed the bard whose name for evermore
  4720	   Their children's children would in vain adore
  4721	   With the remorse of ages; and the crown
  4722	   Which Petrarch's laureate brow supremely wore,
  4723	   Upon a far and foreign soil had grown,
  4724	His life, his fame, his grave, though rifled--not thine own.
  4725	
  4726	LVIII.
  4727	
  4728	   Boccaccio to his parent earth bequeathed
  4729	   His dust,--and lies it not her great among,
  4730	   With many a sweet and solemn requiem breathed
  4731	   O'er him who formed the Tuscan's siren tongue?
  4732	   That music in itself, whose sounds are song,
  4733	   The poetry of speech?  No;--even his tomb
  4734	   Uptorn, must bear the hyaena bigots' wrong,
  4735	   No more amidst the meaner dead find room,
  4736	Nor claim a passing sigh, because it told for WHOM?
  4737	
  4738	LIX.
  4739	
  4740	   And Santa Croce wants their mighty dust;
  4741	   Yet for this want more noted, as of yore
  4742	   The Caesar's pageant, shorn of Brutus' bust,
  4743	   Did but of Rome's best son remind her more:
  4744	   Happier Ravenna! on thy hoary shore,
  4745	   Fortress of falling empire! honoured sleeps
  4746	   The immortal exile;--Arqua, too, her store
  4747	   Of tuneful relics proudly claims and keeps,
  4748	While Florence vainly begs her banished dead, and weeps.
  4749	
  4750	LX.
  4751	
  4752	   What is her pyramid of precious stones?
  4753	   Of porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues
  4754	   Of gem and marble, to encrust the bones
  4755	   Of merchant-dukes? the momentary dews
  4756	   Which, sparkling to the twilight stars, infuse
  4757	   Freshness in the green turf that wraps the dead,
  4758	   Whose names are mausoleums of the Muse,
  4759	   Are gently prest with far more reverent tread
  4760	Than ever paced the slab which paves the princely head.
  4761	
  4762	LXI.
  4763	
  4764	   There be more things to greet the heart and eyes
  4765	   In Arno's dome of Art's most princely shrine,
  4766	   Where Sculpture with her rainbow sister vies;
  4767	   There be more marvels yet--but not for mine;
  4768	   For I have been accustomed to entwine
  4769	   My thoughts with Nature rather in the fields
  4770	   Than Art in galleries:  though a work divine
  4771	   Calls for my spirit's homage, yet it yields
  4772	Less than it feels, because the weapon which it wields
  4773	
  4774	LXII.
  4775	
  4776	   Is of another temper, and I roam
  4777	   By Thrasimene's lake, in the defiles
  4778	   Fatal to Roman rashness, more at home;
  4779	   For there the Carthaginian's warlike wiles
  4780	   Come back before me, as his skill beguiles
  4781	   The host between the mountains and the shore,
  4782	   Where Courage falls in her despairing files,
  4783	   And torrents, swoll'n to rivers with their gore,
  4784	Reek through the sultry plain, with legions scattered o'er,
  4785	
  4786	LXIII.
  4787	
  4788	   Like to a forest felled by mountain winds;
  4789	   And such the storm of battle on this day,
  4790	   And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds
  4791	   To all save carnage, that, beneath the fray,
  4792	   An earthquake reeled unheededly away!
  4793	   None felt stern Nature rocking at his feet,
  4794	   And yawning forth a grave for those who lay
  4795	   Upon their bucklers for a winding-sheet;
  4796	Such is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet.
  4797	
  4798	LXIV.
  4799	
  4800	   The Earth to them was as a rolling bark
  4801	   Which bore them to Eternity; they saw
  4802	   The Ocean round, but had no time to mark
  4803	   The motions of their vessel:  Nature's law,
  4804	   In them suspended, recked not of the awe
  4805	   Which reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds
  4806	   Plunge in the clouds for refuge, and withdraw
  4807	   From their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds
  4808	Stumble o'er heaving plains, and man's dread hath no words.
  4809	
  4810	LXV.
  4811	
  4812	   Far other scene is Thrasimene now;
  4813	   Her lake a sheet of silver, and her plain
  4814	   Rent by no ravage save the gentle plough;
  4815	   Her aged trees rise thick as once the slain
  4816	   Lay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en--
  4817	   A little rill of scanty stream and bed--
  4818	   A name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;
  4819	   And Sanguinetto tells ye where the dead
  4820	Made the earth wet, and turned the unwilling waters red.
  4821	
  4822	LXVI.
  4823	
  4824	   But thou, Clitumnus! in thy sweetest wave
  4825	   Of the most living crystal that was e'er
  4826	   The haunt of river nymph, to gaze and lave
  4827	   Her limbs where nothing hid them, thou dost rear
  4828	   Thy grassy banks whereon the milk-white steer
  4829	   Grazes; the purest god of gentle waters!
  4830	   And most serene of aspect, and most clear:
  4831	   Surely that stream was unprofaned by slaughters,
  4832	A mirror and a bath for Beauty's youngest daughters!
  4833	
  4834	LXVII.
  4835	
  4836	   And on thy happy shore a temple still,
  4837	   Of small and delicate proportion, keeps,
  4838	   Upon a mild declivity of hill,
  4839	   Its memory of thee; beneath it sweeps
  4840	   Thy current's calmness; oft from out it leaps
  4841	   The finny darter with the glittering scales,
  4842	   Who dwells and revels in thy glassy deeps;
  4843	   While, chance, some scattered water-lily sails
  4844	Down where the shallower wave still tells its bubbling tales.
  4845	
  4846	LXVIII.
  4847	
  4848	   Pass not unblest the genius of the place!
  4849	   If through the air a zephyr more serene
  4850	   Win to the brow, 'tis his; and if ye trace
  4851	   Along his margin a more eloquent green,
  4852	   If on the heart the freshness of the scene
  4853	   Sprinkle its coolness, and from the dry dust
  4854	   Of weary life a moment lave it clean
  4855	   With Nature's baptism,--'tis to him ye must
  4856	Pay orisons for this suspension of disgust.
  4857	
  4858	LXIX.
  4859	
  4860	   The roar of waters!--from the headlong height
  4861	   Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;
  4862	   The fall of waters! rapid as the light
  4863	   The flashing mass foams shaking the abyss;
  4864	   The hell of waters! where they howl and hiss,
  4865	   And boil in endless torture; while the sweat
  4866	   Of their great agony, wrung out from this
  4867	   Their Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet
  4868	That gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,
  4869	
  4870	LXX.
  4871	
  4872	   And mounts in spray the skies, and thence again
  4873	   Returns in an unceasing shower, which round,
  4874	   With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,
  4875	   Is an eternal April to the ground,
  4876	   Making it all one emerald.  How profound
  4877	   The gulf! and how the giant element
  4878	   From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,
  4879	   Crushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent
  4880	With his fierce footsteps, yield in chasms a fearful vent
  4881	
  4882	LXXI.
  4883	
  4884	   To the broad column which rolls on, and shows
  4885	   More like the fountain of an infant sea
  4886	   Torn from the womb of mountains by the throes
  4887	   Of a new world, than only thus to be
  4888	   Parent of rivers, which flow gushingly,
  4889	   With many windings through the vale:--Look back!
  4890	   Lo! where it comes like an eternity,
  4891	   As if to sweep down all things in its track,
  4892	Charming the eye with dread,--a matchless cataract,
  4893	
  4894	LXXII.
  4895	
  4896	   Horribly beautiful! but on the verge,
  4897	   From side to side, beneath the glittering morn,
  4898	   An Iris sits, amidst the infernal surge,
  4899	   Like Hope upon a deathbed, and, unworn
  4900	   Its steady dyes, while all around is torn
  4901	   By the distracted waters, bears serene
  4902	   Its brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:
  4903	   Resembling, mid the torture of the scene,
  4904	Love watching Madness with unalterable mien.
  4905	
  4906	LXXIII.
  4907	
  4908	   Once more upon the woody Apennine,
  4909	   The infant Alps, which--had I not before
  4910	   Gazed on their mightier parents, where the pine
  4911	   Sits on more shaggy summits, and where roar
  4912	   The thundering lauwine--might be worshipped more;
  4913	   But I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear
  4914	   Her never-trodden snow, and seen the hoar
  4915	   Glaciers of bleak Mont Blanc both far and near,
  4916	And in Chimari heard the thunder-hills of fear,
  4917	
  4918	LXXIV.
  4919	
  4920	   The Acroceraunian mountains of old name;
  4921	   And on Parnassus seen the eagles fly
  4922	   Like spirits of the spot, as 'twere for fame,
  4923	   For still they soared unutterably high:
  4924	   I've looked on Ida with a Trojan's eye;
  4925	   Athos, Olympus, AEtna, Atlas, made
  4926	   These hills seem things of lesser dignity,
  4927	   All, save the lone Soracte's height displayed,
  4928	Not NOW in snow, which asks the lyric Roman's aid
  4929	
  4930	LXXV.
  4931	
  4932	   For our remembrance, and from out the plain
  4933	   Heaves like a long-swept wave about to break,
  4934	   And on the curl hangs pausing:  not in vain
  4935	   May he who will his recollections rake,
  4936	   And quote in classic raptures, and awake
  4937	   The hills with Latian echoes; I abhorred
  4938	   Too much, to conquer for the poet's sake,
  4939	   The drilled dull lesson, forced down word by word
  4940	In my repugnant youth, with pleasure to record
  4941	
  4942	LXXVI.
  4943	
  4944	   Aught that recalls the daily drug which turned
  4945	   My sickening memory; and, though Time hath taught
  4946	   My mind to meditate what then it learned,
  4947	   Yet such the fixed inveteracy wrought
  4948	   By the impatience of my early thought,
  4949	   That, with the freshness wearing out before
  4950	   My mind could relish what it might have sought,
  4951	   If free to choose, I cannot now restore
  4952	Its health; but what it then detested, still abhor.
  4953	
  4954	LXXVII.
  4955	
  4956	   Then farewell, Horace; whom I hated so,
  4957	   Not for thy faults, but mine; it is a curse
  4958	   To understand, not feel, thy lyric flow,
  4959	   To comprehend, but never love thy verse,
  4960	   Although no deeper moralist rehearse
  4961	   Our little life, nor bard prescribe his art,
  4962	   Nor livelier satirist the conscience pierce,
  4963	   Awakening without wounding the touched heart,
  4964	Yet fare thee well--upon Soracte's ridge we part.
  4965	
  4966	LXXVIII.
  4967	
  4968	   O Rome! my country! city of the soul!
  4969	   The orphans of the heart must turn to thee,
  4970	   Lone mother of dead empires! and control
  4971	   In their shut breasts their petty misery.
  4972	   What are our woes and sufferance?  Come and see
  4973	   The cypress, hear the owl, and plod your way
  4974	   O'er steps of broken thrones and temples, Ye!
  4975	   Whose agonies are evils of a day--
  4976	A world is at our feet as fragile as our clay.
  4977	
  4978	LXXIX.
  4979	
  4980	   The Niobe of nations! there she stands,
  4981	   Childless and crownless, in her voiceless woe;
  4982	   An empty urn within her withered hands,
  4983	   Whose holy dust was scattered long ago;
  4984	   The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;
  4985	   The very sepulchres lie tenantless
  4986	   Of their heroic dwellers:  dost thou flow,
  4987	   Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?
  4988	Rise, with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress!
  4989	
  4990	LXXX.
  4991	
  4992	   The Goth, the Christian, Time, War, Flood, and Fire,
  4993	   Have dwelt upon the seven-hilled city's pride:
  4994	   She saw her glories star by star expire,
  4995	   And up the steep barbarian monarchs ride,
  4996	   Where the car climbed the Capitol; far and wide
  4997	   Temple and tower went down, nor left a site;--
  4998	   Chaos of ruins! who shall trace the void,
  4999	   O'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,
  5000	And say, 'Here was, or is,' where all is doubly night?
  5001	
  5002	LXXXI.
  5003	
  5004	   The double night of ages, and of her,
  5005	   Night's daughter, Ignorance, hath wrapt, and wrap
  5006	   All round us; we but feel our way to err:
  5007	   The ocean hath its chart, the stars their map;
  5008	   And knowledge spreads them on her ample lap;
  5009	   But Rome is as the desert, where we steer
  5010	   Stumbling o'er recollections:  now we clap
  5011	   Our hands, and cry, 'Eureka!' it is clear--
  5012	When but some false mirage of ruin rises near.
  5013	
  5014	LXXXII.
  5015	
  5016	   Alas, the lofty city! and alas
  5017	   The trebly hundred triumphs! and the day
  5018	   When Brutus made the dagger's edge surpass
  5019	   The conqueror's sword in bearing fame away!
  5020	   Alas for Tully's voice, and Virgil's lay,
  5021	   And Livy's pictured page!  But these shall be
  5022	   Her resurrection; all beside--decay.
  5023	   Alas for Earth, for never shall we see
  5024	That brightness in her eye she bore when Rome was free!
  5025	
  5026	LXXXIII.
  5027	
  5028	   O thou, whose chariot rolled on Fortune's wheel,
  5029	   Triumphant Sylla!  Thou, who didst subdue
  5030	   Thy country's foes ere thou wouldst pause to feel
  5031	   The wrath of thy own wrongs, or reap the due
  5032	   Of hoarded vengeance till thine eagles flew
  5033	   O'er prostrate Asia;--thou, who with thy frown
  5034	   Annihilated senates--Roman, too,
  5035	   With all thy vices, for thou didst lay down
  5036	With an atoning smile a more than earthly crown--
  5037	
  5038	LXXXIV.
  5039	
  5040	   The dictatorial wreath,--couldst thou divine
  5041	   To what would one day dwindle that which made
  5042	   Thee more than mortal? and that so supine
  5043	   By aught than Romans Rome should thus be laid?
  5044	   She who was named eternal, and arrayed
  5045	   Her warriors but to conquer--she who veiled
  5046	   Earth with her haughty shadow, and displayed
  5047	   Until the o'er-canopied horizon failed,
  5048	Her rushing wings--Oh! she who was almighty hailed!
  5049	
  5050	LXXXV.
  5051	
  5052	   Sylla was first of victors; but our own,
  5053	   The sagest of usurpers, Cromwell!--he
  5054	   Too swept off senates while he hewed the throne
  5055	   Down to a block--immortal rebel!  See
  5056	   What crimes it costs to be a moment free
  5057	   And famous through all ages!  But beneath
  5058	   His fate the moral lurks of destiny;
  5059	   His day of double victory and death
  5060	Beheld him win two realms, and, happier, yield his breath.
  5061	
  5062	LXXXVI.
  5063	
  5064	   The third of the same moon whose former course
  5065	   Had all but crowned him, on the self-same day
  5066	   Deposed him gently from his throne of force,
  5067	   And laid him with the earth's preceding clay.
  5068	   And showed not Fortune thus how fame and sway,
  5069	   And all we deem delightful, and consume
  5070	   Our souls to compass through each arduous way,
  5071	   Are in her eyes less happy than the tomb?
  5072	Were they but so in man's, how different were his doom!
  5073	
  5074	LXXXVII.
  5075	
  5076	   And thou, dread statue! yet existent in
  5077	   The austerest form of naked majesty,
  5078	   Thou who beheldest, mid the assassins' din,
  5079	   At thy bathed base the bloody Caesar lie,
  5080	   Folding his robe in dying dignity,
  5081	   An offering to thine altar from the queen
  5082	   Of gods and men, great Nemesis! did he die,
  5083	   And thou, too, perish, Pompey? have ye been
  5084	Victors of countless kings, or puppets of a scene?
  5085	
  5086	LXXXVIII.
  5087	
  5088	   And thou, the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome!
  5089	   She-wolf! whose brazen-imaged dugs impart
  5090	   The milk of conquest yet within the dome
  5091	   Where, as a monument of antique art,
  5092	   Thou standest:--Mother of the mighty heart,
  5093	   Which the great founder sucked from thy wild teat,
  5094	   Scorched by the Roman Jove's ethereal dart,
  5095	   And thy limbs blacked with lightning--dost thou yet
  5096	Guard thine immortal cubs, nor thy fond charge forget?
  5097	
  5098	LXXXIX.
  5099	
  5100	   Thou dost;--but all thy foster-babes are dead--
  5101	   The men of iron; and the world hath reared
  5102	   Cities from out their sepulchres:  men bled
  5103	   In imitation of the things they feared,
  5104	   And fought and conquered, and the same course steered,
  5105	   At apish distance; but as yet none have,
  5106	   Nor could, the same supremacy have neared,
  5107	   Save one vain man, who is not in the grave,
  5108	But, vanquished by himself, to his own slaves a slave,
  5109	
  5110	XC.
  5111	
  5112	   The fool of false dominion--and a kind
  5113	   Of bastard Caesar, following him of old
  5114	   With steps unequal; for the Roman's mind
  5115	   Was modelled in a less terrestrial mould,
  5116	   With passions fiercer, yet a judgment cold,
  5117	   And an immortal instinct which redeemed
  5118	   The frailties of a heart so soft, yet bold.
  5119	   Alcides with the distaff now he seemed
  5120	At Cleopatra's feet, and now himself he beamed.
  5121	
  5122	XCI.
  5123	
  5124	   And came, and saw, and conquered.  But the man
  5125	   Who would have tamed his eagles down to flee,
  5126	   Like a trained falcon, in the Gallic van,
  5127	   Which he, in sooth, long led to victory,
  5128	   With a deaf heart which never seemed to be
  5129	   A listener to itself, was strangely framed;
  5130	   With but one weakest weakness--vanity:
  5131	   Coquettish in ambition, still he aimed
  5132	At what?  Can he avouch, or answer what he claimed?
  5133	
  5134	XCII.
  5135	
  5136	   And would be all or nothing--nor could wait
  5137	   For the sure grave to level him; few years
  5138	   Had fixed him with the Caesars in his fate,
  5139	   On whom we tread:  For THIS the conqueror rears
  5140	   The arch of triumph! and for this the tears
  5141	   And blood of earth flow on as they have flowed,
  5142	   An universal deluge, which appears
  5143	   Without an ark for wretched man's abode,
  5144	And ebbs but to reflow!--Renew thy rainbow, God!
  5145	
  5146	XCIII.
  5147	
  5148	   What from this barren being do we reap?
  5149	   Our senses narrow, and our reason frail,
  5150	   Life short, and truth a gem which loves the deep,
  5151	   And all things weighed in custom's falsest scale;
  5152	   Opinion an omnipotence, whose veil
  5153	   Mantles the earth with darkness, until right
  5154	   And wrong are accidents, and men grow pale
  5155	   Lest their own judgments should become too bright,
  5156	And their free thoughts be crimes, and earth have too much light.
  5157	
  5158	XCIV.
  5159	
  5160	   And thus they plod in sluggish misery,
  5161	   Rotting from sire to son, and age to age,
  5162	   Proud of their trampled nature, and so die,
  5163	   Bequeathing their hereditary rage
  5164	   To the new race of inborn slaves, who wage
  5165	   War for their chains, and rather than be free,
  5166	   Bleed gladiator-like, and still engage
  5167	   Within the same arena where they see
  5168	Their fellows fall before, like leaves of the same tree.
  5169	
  5170	XCV.
  5171	
  5172	   I speak not of men's creeds--they rest between
  5173	   Man and his Maker--but of things allowed,
  5174	   Averred, and known,--and daily, hourly seen--
  5175	   The yoke that is upon us doubly bowed,
  5176	   And the intent of tyranny avowed,
  5177	   The edict of Earth's rulers, who are grown
  5178	   The apes of him who humbled once the proud,
  5179	   And shook them from their slumbers on the throne;
  5180	Too glorious, were this all his mighty arm had done.
  5181	
  5182	XCVI.
  5183	
  5184	   Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,
  5185	   And Freedom find no champion and no child
  5186	   Such as Columbia saw arise when she
  5187	   Sprung forth a Pallas, armed and undefiled?
  5188	   Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,
  5189	   Deep in the unpruned forest, midst the roar
  5190	   Of cataracts, where nursing nature smiled
  5191	   On infant Washington?  Has Earth no more
  5192	Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?
  5193	
  5194	XCVII.
  5195	
  5196	   But France got drunk with blood to vomit crime,
  5197	   And fatal have her Saturnalia been
  5198	   To Freedom's cause, in every age and clime;
  5199	   Because the deadly days which we have seen,
  5200	   And vile Ambition, that built up between
  5201	   Man and his hopes an adamantine wall,
  5202	   And the base pageant last upon the scene,
  5203	   Are grown the pretext for the eternal thrall
  5204	Which nips Life's tree, and dooms man's worst--his second fall.
  5205	
  5206	XCVIII.
  5207	
  5208	   Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,
  5209	   Streams like the thunder-storm AGAINST the wind;
  5210	   Thy trumpet-voice, though broken now and dying,
  5211	   The loudest still the tempest leaves behind;
  5212	   Thy tree hath lost its blossoms, and the rind,
  5213	   Chopped by the axe, looks rough and little worth,
  5214	   But the sap lasts,--and still the seed we find
  5215	   Sown deep, even in the bosom of the North;
  5216	So shall a better spring less bitter fruit bring forth.
  5217	
  5218	XCIX.
  5219	
  5220	   There is a stern round tower of other days,
  5221	   Firm as a fortress, with its fence of stone,
  5222	   Such as an army's baffled strength delays,
  5223	   Standing with half its battlements alone,
  5224	   And with two thousand years of ivy grown,
  5225	   The garland of eternity, where wave
  5226	   The green leaves over all by time o'erthrown:
  5227	   What was this tower of strength? within its cave
  5228	What treasure lay so locked, so hid?--A woman's grave.
  5229	
  5230	C.
  5231	
  5232	   But who was she, the lady of the dead,
  5233	   Tombed in a palace?  Was she chaste and fair?
  5234	   Worthy a king's--or more--a Roman's bed?
  5235	   What race of chiefs and heroes did she bear?
  5236	   What daughter of her beauties was the heir?
  5237	   How lived--how loved--how died she?  Was she not
  5238	   So honoured--and conspicuously there,
  5239	   Where meaner relics must not dare to rot,
  5240	Placed to commemorate a more than mortal lot?
  5241	
  5242	CI.
  5243	
  5244	   Was she as those who love their lords, or they
  5245	   Who love the lords of others? such have been
  5246	   Even in the olden time, Rome's annals say.
  5247	   Was she a matron of Cornelia's mien,
  5248	   Or the light air of Egypt's graceful queen,
  5249	   Profuse of joy; or 'gainst it did she war,
  5250	   Inveterate in virtue?  Did she lean
  5251	   To the soft side of the heart, or wisely bar
  5252	Love from amongst her griefs?--for such the affections are.
  5253	
  5254	CII.
  5255	
  5256	   Perchance she died in youth:  it may be, bowed
  5257	   With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb
  5258	   That weighed upon her gentle dust, a cloud
  5259	   Might gather o'er her beauty, and a gloom
  5260	   In her dark eye, prophetic of the doom
  5261	   Heaven gives its favourites--early death; yet shed
  5262	   A sunset charm around her, and illume
  5263	   With hectic light, the Hesperus of the dead,
  5264	Of her consuming cheek the autumnal leaf-like red.
  5265	
  5266	CIII.
  5267	
  5268	   Perchance she died in age--surviving all,
  5269	   Charms, kindred, children--with the silver grey
  5270	   On her long tresses, which might yet recall,
  5271	   It may be, still a something of the day
  5272	   When they were braided, and her proud array
  5273	   And lovely form were envied, praised, and eyed
  5274	   By Rome--But whither would Conjecture stray?
  5275	   Thus much alone we know--Metella died,
  5276	The wealthiest Roman's wife:  Behold his love or pride!
  5277	
  5278	CIV.
  5279	
  5280	   I know not why--but standing thus by thee
  5281	   It seems as if I had thine inmate known,
  5282	   Thou Tomb! and other days come back on me
  5283	   With recollected music, though the tone
  5284	   Is changed and solemn, like the cloudy groan
  5285	   Of dying thunder on the distant wind;
  5286	   Yet could I seat me by this ivied stone
  5287	   Till I had bodied forth the heated mind,
  5288	Forms from the floating wreck which ruin leaves behind;
  5289	
  5290	CV.
  5291	
  5292	   And from the planks, far shattered o'er the rocks,
  5293	   Built me a little bark of hope, once more
  5294	   To battle with the ocean and the shocks
  5295	   Of the loud breakers, and the ceaseless roar
  5296	   Which rushes on the solitary shore
  5297	   Where all lies foundered that was ever dear:
  5298	   But could I gather from the wave-worn store
  5299	   Enough for my rude boat, where should I steer?
  5300	There woos no home, nor hope, nor life, save what is here.
  5301	
  5302	CVI.
  5303	
  5304	   Then let the winds howl on! their harmony
  5305	   Shall henceforth be my music, and the night
  5306	   The sound shall temper with the owlet's cry,
  5307	   As I now hear them, in the fading light
  5308	   Dim o'er the bird of darkness' native site,
  5309	   Answer each other on the Palatine,
  5310	   With their large eyes, all glistening grey and bright,
  5311	   And sailing pinions.--Upon such a shrine
  5312	What are our petty griefs?--let me not number mine.
  5313	
  5314	CVII.
  5315	
  5316	   Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower grown
  5317	   Matted and massed together, hillocks heaped
  5318	   On what were chambers, arch crushed, column strown
  5319	   In fragments, choked-up vaults, and frescoes steeped
  5320	   In subterranean damps, where the owl peeped,
  5321	   Deeming it midnight:--Temples, baths, or halls?
  5322	   Pronounce who can; for all that Learning reaped
  5323	   From her research hath been, that these are walls--
  5324	Behold the Imperial Mount! 'tis thus the mighty falls.
  5325	
  5326	CVIII.
  5327	
  5328	   There is the moral of all human tales:
  5329	   'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past,
  5330	   First Freedom, and then Glory--when that fails,
  5331	   Wealth, vice, corruption--barbarism at last.
  5332	   And History, with all her volumes vast,
  5333	   Hath but ONE page,--'tis better written here,
  5334	   Where gorgeous Tyranny hath thus amassed
  5335	   All treasures, all delights, that eye or ear,
  5336	Heart, soul could seek, tongue ask--Away with words! draw near,
  5337	
  5338	CIX.
  5339	
  5340	   Admire, exult--despise--laugh, weep--for here
  5341	   There is such matter for all feeling:--Man!
  5342	   Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear,
  5343	   Ages and realms are crowded in this span,
  5344	   This mountain, whose obliterated plan
  5345	   The pyramid of empires pinnacled,
  5346	   Of Glory's gewgaws shining in the van
  5347	   Till the sun's rays with added flame were filled!
  5348	Where are its golden roofs? where those who dared to build?
  5349	
  5350	CX.
  5351	
  5352	   Tully was not so eloquent as thou,
  5353	   Thou nameless column with the buried base!
  5354	   What are the laurels of the Caesar's brow?
  5355	   Crown me with ivy from his dwelling-place.
  5356	   Whose arch or pillar meets me in the face,
  5357	   Titus or Trajan's?  No; 'tis that of Time:
  5358	   Triumph, arch, pillar, all he doth displace,
  5359	   Scoffing; and apostolic statues climb
  5360	To crush the imperial urn, whose ashes slept sublime,
  5361	
  5362	CXI.
  5363	
  5364	   Buried in air, the deep blue sky of Rome,
  5365	   And looking to the stars; they had contained
  5366	   A spirit which with these would find a home,
  5367	   The last of those who o'er the whole earth reigned,
  5368	   The Roman globe, for after none sustained
  5369	   But yielded back his conquests:--he was more
  5370	   Than a mere Alexander, and unstained
  5371	   With household blood and wine, serenely wore
  5372	His sovereign virtues--still we Trajan's name adore.
  5373	
  5374	CXII.
  5375	
  5376	   Where is the rock of Triumph, the high place
  5377	   Where Rome embraced her heroes? where the steep
  5378	   Tarpeian--fittest goal of Treason's race,
  5379	   The promontory whence the traitor's leap
  5380	   Cured all ambition?  Did the Conquerors heap
  5381	   Their spoils here?  Yes; and in yon field below,
  5382	   A thousand years of silenced factions sleep--
  5383	   The Forum, where the immortal accents glow,
  5384	And still the eloquent air breathes--burns with Cicero!
  5385	
  5386	CXIII.
  5387	
  5388	   The field of freedom, faction, fame, and blood:
  5389	   Here a proud people's passions were exhaled,
  5390	   From the first hour of empire in the bud
  5391	   To that when further worlds to conquer failed;
  5392	   But long before had Freedom's face been veiled,
  5393	   And Anarchy assumed her attributes:
  5394	   Till every lawless soldier who assailed
  5395	   Trod on the trembling Senate's slavish mutes,
  5396	Or raised the venal voice of baser prostitutes.
  5397	
  5398	CXIV.
  5399	
  5400	   Then turn we to our latest tribune's name,
  5401	   From her ten thousand tyrants turn to thee,
  5402	   Redeemer of dark centuries of shame--
  5403	   The friend of Petrarch--hope of Italy--
  5404	   Rienzi! last of Romans!  While the tree
  5405	   Of freedom's withered trunk puts forth a leaf,
  5406	   Even for thy tomb a garland let it be--
  5407	   The forum's champion, and the people's chief--
  5408	Her new-born Numa thou, with reign, alas! too brief.
  5409	
  5410	CXV.
  5411	
  5412	   Egeria! sweet creation of some heart
  5413	   Which found no mortal resting-place so fair
  5414	   As thine ideal breast; whate'er thou art
  5415	   Or wert,--a young Aurora of the air,
  5416	   The nympholepsy of some fond despair;
  5417	   Or, it might be, a beauty of the earth,
  5418	   Who found a more than common votary there
  5419	   Too much adoring; whatsoe'er thy birth,
  5420	Thou wert a beautiful thought, and softly bodied forth.
  5421	
  5422	CXVI.
  5423	
  5424	   The mosses of thy fountain still are sprinkled
  5425	   With thine Elysian water-drops; the face
  5426	   Of thy cave-guarded spring, with years unwrinkled,
  5427	   Reflects the meek-eyed genius of the place,
  5428	   Whose green wild margin now no more erase
  5429	   Art's works; nor must the delicate waters sleep,
  5430	   Prisoned in marble, bubbling from the base
  5431	   Of the cleft statue, with a gentle leap
  5432	The rill runs o'er, and round, fern, flowers, and ivy creep,
  5433	
  5434	CXVII.
  5435	
  5436	   Fantastically tangled; the green hills
  5437	   Are clothed with early blossoms, through the grass
  5438	   The quick-eyed lizard rustles, and the bills
  5439	   Of summer birds sing welcome as ye pass;
  5440	   Flowers fresh in hue, and many in their class,
  5441	   Implore the pausing step, and with their dyes
  5442	   Dance in the soft breeze in a fairy mass;
  5443	   The sweetness of the violet's deep blue eyes,
  5444	Kissed by the breath of heaven, seems coloured by its skies.
  5445	
  5446	CXVIII.
  5447	
  5448	   Here didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,
  5449	   Egeria! thy all heavenly bosom beating
  5450	   For the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;
  5451	   The purple Midnight veiled that mystic meeting
  5452	   With her most starry canopy, and seating
  5453	   Thyself by thine adorer, what befell?
  5454	   This cave was surely shaped out for the greeting
  5455	   Of an enamoured Goddess, and the cell
  5456	Haunted by holy Love--the earliest oracle!
  5457	
  5458	CXIX.
  5459	
  5460	   And didst thou not, thy breast to his replying,
  5461	   Blend a celestial with a human heart;
  5462	   And Love, which dies as it was born, in sighing,
  5463	   Share with immortal transports? could thine art
  5464	   Make them indeed immortal, and impart
  5465	   The purity of heaven to earthly joys,
  5466	   Expel the venom and not blunt the dart--
  5467	   The dull satiety which all destroys--
  5468	And root from out the soul the deadly weed which cloys?
  5469	
  5470	CXX.
  5471	
  5472	   Alas! our young affections run to waste,
  5473	   Or water but the desert:  whence arise
  5474	   But weeds of dark luxuriance, tares of haste,
  5475	   Rank at the core, though tempting to the eyes,
  5476	   Flowers whose wild odours breathe but agonies,
  5477	   And trees whose gums are poison; such the plants
  5478	   Which spring beneath her steps as Passion flies
  5479	   O'er the world's wilderness, and vainly pants
  5480	For some celestial fruit forbidden to our wants.
  5481	
  5482	CXXI.
  5483	
  5484	   O Love! no habitant of earth thou art--
  5485	   An unseen seraph, we believe in thee,--
  5486	   A faith whose martyrs are the broken heart,
  5487	   But never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see,
  5488	   The naked eye, thy form, as it should be;
  5489	   The mind hath made thee, as it peopled heaven,
  5490	   Even with its own desiring phantasy,
  5491	   And to a thought such shape and image given,
  5492	As haunts the unquenched soul--parched--wearied--wrung--and riven.
  5493	
  5494	CXXII.
  5495	
  5496	   Of its own beauty is the mind diseased,
  5497	   And fevers into false creation;--where,
  5498	   Where are the forms the sculptor's soul hath seized?
  5499	   In him alone.  Can Nature show so fair?
  5500	   Where are the charms and virtues which we dare
  5501	   Conceive in boyhood and pursue as men,
  5502	   The unreached Paradise of our despair,
  5503	   Which o'er-informs the pencil and the pen,
  5504	And overpowers the page where it would bloom again.
  5505	
  5506	CXXIII.
  5507	
  5508	   Who loves, raves--'tis youth's frenzy--but the cure
  5509	   Is bitterer still; as charm by charm unwinds
  5510	   Which robed our idols, and we see too sure
  5511	   Nor worth nor beauty dwells from out the mind's
  5512	   Ideal shape of such; yet still it binds
  5513	   The fatal spell, and still it draws us on,
  5514	   Reaping the whirlwind from the oft-sown winds;
  5515	   The stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,
  5516	Seems ever near the prize--wealthiest when most undone.
  5517	
  5518	CXXIV.
  5519	
  5520	   We wither from our youth, we gasp away--
  5521	   Sick--sick; unfound the boon, unslaked the thirst,
  5522	   Though to the last, in verge of our decay,
  5523	   Some phantom lures, such as we sought at first--
  5524	   But all too late,--so are we doubly curst.
  5525	   Love, fame, ambition, avarice--'tis the same--
  5526	   Each idle, and all ill, and none the worst--
  5527	   For all are meteors with a different name,
  5528	And death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.
  5529	
  5530	CXXV.
  5531	
  5532	   Few--none--find what they love or could have loved:
  5533	   Though accident, blind contact, and the strong
  5534	   Necessity of loving, have removed
  5535	   Antipathies--but to recur, ere long,
  5536	   Envenomed with irrevocable wrong;
  5537	   And Circumstance, that unspiritual god
  5538	   And miscreator, makes and helps along
  5539	   Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod,
  5540	Whose touch turns hope to dust--the dust we all have trod.
  5541	
  5542	CXXVI.
  5543	
  5544	   Our life is a false nature--'tis not in
  5545	   The harmony of things,--this hard decree,
  5546	   This uneradicable taint of sin,
  5547	   This boundless upas, this all-blasting tree,
  5548	   Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be
  5549	   The skies which rain their plagues on men like dew--
  5550	   Disease, death, bondage, all the woes we see--
  5551	   And worse, the woes we see not--which throb through
  5552	The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.
  5553	
  5554	CXXVII.
  5555	
  5556	   Yet let us ponder boldly--'tis a base
  5557	   Abandonment of reason to resign
  5558	   Our right of thought--our last and only place
  5559	   Of refuge; this, at least, shall still be mine:
  5560	   Though from our birth the faculty divine
  5561	   Is chained and tortured--cabined, cribbed, confined,
  5562	   And bred in darkness, lest the truth should shine
  5563	   Too brightly on the unprepared mind,
  5564	The beam pours in, for time and skill will couch the blind.
  5565	
  5566	CXXVIII.
  5567	
  5568	   Arches on arches! as it were that Rome,
  5569	   Collecting the chief trophies of her line,
  5570	   Would build up all her triumphs in one dome,
  5571	   Her Coliseum stands; the moonbeams shine
  5572	   As 'twere its natural torches, for divine
  5573	   Should be the light which streams here, to illume
  5574	   This long explored but still exhaustless mine
  5575	   Of contemplation; and the azure gloom
  5576	Of an Italian night, where the deep skies assume
  5577	
  5578	CXXIX.
  5579	
  5580	   Hues which have words, and speak to ye of heaven,
  5581	   Floats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,
  5582	   And shadows forth its glory.  There is given
  5583	   Unto the things of earth, which Time hath bent,
  5584	   A spirit's feeling, and where he hath leant
  5585	   His hand, but broke his scythe, there is a power
  5586	   And magic in the ruined battlement,
  5587	   For which the palace of the present hour
  5588	Must yield its pomp, and wait till ages are its dower.
  5589	
  5590	CXXX.
  5591	
  5592	   O Time! the beautifier of the dead,
  5593	   Adorner of the ruin, comforter
  5594	   And only healer when the heart hath bled--
  5595	   Time! the corrector where our judgments err,
  5596	   The test of truth, love,--sole philosopher,
  5597	   For all beside are sophists, from thy thrift,
  5598	   Which never loses though it doth defer--
  5599	   Time, the avenger! unto thee I lift
  5600	My hands, and eyes, and heart, and crave of thee a gift:
  5601	
  5602	CXXXI.
  5603	
  5604	   Amidst this wreck, where thou hast made a shrine
  5605	   And temple more divinely desolate,
  5606	   Among thy mightier offerings here are mine,
  5607	   Ruins of years--though few, yet full of fate:
  5608	   If thou hast ever seen me too elate,
  5609	   Hear me not; but if calmly I have borne
  5610	   Good, and reserved my pride against the hate
  5611	   Which shall not whelm me, let me not have worn
  5612	This iron in my soul in vain--shall THEY not mourn?
  5613	
  5614	CXXXII.
  5615	
  5616	   And thou, who never yet of human wrong
  5617	   Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!
  5618	   Here, where the ancients paid thee homage long--
  5619	   Thou, who didst call the Furies from the abyss,
  5620	   And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss
  5621	   For that unnatural retribution--just,
  5622	   Had it but been from hands less near--in this
  5623	   Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!
  5624	Dost thou not hear my heart?--Awake! thou shalt, and must.
  5625	
  5626	CXXXIII.
  5627	
  5628	   It is not that I may not have incurred
  5629	   For my ancestral faults or mine the wound
  5630	   I bleed withal, and had it been conferred
  5631	   With a just weapon, it had flowed unbound.
  5632	   But now my blood shall not sink in the ground;
  5633	   To thee I do devote it--THOU shalt take
  5634	   The vengeance, which shall yet be sought and found,
  5635	   Which if _I_ have not taken for the sake--
  5636	But let that pass--I sleep, but thou shalt yet awake.
  5637	
  5638	CXXXIV.
  5639	
  5640	   And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now
  5641	   I shrink from what is suffered:  let him speak
  5642	   Who hath beheld decline upon my brow,
  5643	   Or seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;
  5644	   But in this page a record will I seek.
  5645	   Not in the air shall these my words disperse,
  5646	   Though I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak
  5647	   The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,
  5648	And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!
  5649	
  5650	CXXXV.
  5651	
  5652	   That curse shall be forgiveness.--Have I not--
  5653	   Hear me, my mother Earth! behold it, Heaven!--
  5654	   Have I not had to wrestle with my lot?
  5655	   Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?
  5656	   Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,
  5657	   Hopes sapped, name blighted, Life's life lied away?
  5658	   And only not to desperation driven,
  5659	   Because not altogether of such clay
  5660	As rots into the souls of those whom I survey.
  5661	
  5662	CXXXVI.
  5663	
  5664	   From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy
  5665	   Have I not seen what human things could do?
  5666	   From the loud roar of foaming calumny
  5667	   To the small whisper of the as paltry few
  5668	   And subtler venom of the reptile crew,
  5669	   The Janus glance of whose significant eye,
  5670	   Learning to lie with silence, would SEEM true,
  5671	   And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,
  5672	Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.
  5673	
  5674	CXXXVII.
  5675	
  5676	   But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:
  5677	   My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,
  5678	   And my frame perish even in conquering pain,
  5679	   But there is that within me which shall tire
  5680	   Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire:
  5681	   Something unearthly, which they deem not of,
  5682	   Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,
  5683	   Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move
  5684	In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of love.
  5685	
  5686	CXXXVIII.
  5687	
  5688	   The seal is set.--Now welcome, thou dread Power
  5689	   Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here
  5690	   Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour
  5691	   With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear:
  5692	   Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear
  5693	   Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene
  5694	   Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear
  5695	   That we become a part of what has been,
  5696	And grow unto the spot, all-seeing but unseen.
  5697	
  5698	CXXXIX.
  5699	
  5700	   And here the buzz of eager nations ran,
  5701	   In murmured pity, or loud-roared applause,
  5702	   As man was slaughtered by his fellow-man.
  5703	   And wherefore slaughtered? wherefore, but because
  5704	   Such were the bloody circus' genial laws,
  5705	   And the imperial pleasure.--Wherefore not?
  5706	   What matters where we fall to fill the maws
  5707	   Of worms--on battle-plains or listed spot?
  5708	Both are but theatres where the chief actors rot.
  5709	
  5710	CXL.
  5711	
  5712	   I see before me the Gladiator lie:
  5713	   He leans upon his hand--his manly brow
  5714	   Consents to death, but conquers agony,
  5715	   And his drooped head sinks gradually low--
  5716	   And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
  5717	   From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,
  5718	   Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now
  5719	   The arena swims around him:  he is gone,
  5720	Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.
  5721	
  5722	CXLI.
  5723	
  5724	   He heard it, but he heeded not--his eyes
  5725	   Were with his heart, and that was far away;
  5726	   He recked not of the life he lost nor prize,
  5727	   But where his rude hut by the Danube lay,
  5728	   THERE were his young barbarians all at play,
  5729	   THERE was their Dacian mother--he, their sire,
  5730	   Butchered to make a Roman holiday--
  5731	   All this rushed with his blood--Shall he expire,
  5732	And unavenged?--Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!
  5733	
  5734	CXLII.
  5735	
  5736	   But here, where murder breathed her bloody steam;
  5737	   And here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,
  5738	   And roared or murmured like a mountain-stream
  5739	   Dashing or winding as its torrent strays;
  5740	   Here, where the Roman million's blame or praise
  5741	   Was death or life, the playthings of a crowd,
  5742	   My voice sounds much--and fall the stars' faint rays
  5743	   On the arena void--seats crushed, walls bowed,
  5744	And galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud.
  5745	
  5746	CXLIII.
  5747	
  5748	   A ruin--yet what ruin! from its mass
  5749	   Walls, palaces, half-cities, have been reared;
  5750	   Yet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,
  5751	   And marvel where the spoil could have appeared.
  5752	   Hath it indeed been plundered, or but cleared?
  5753	   Alas! developed, opens the decay,
  5754	   When the colossal fabric's form is neared:
  5755	   It will not bear the brightness of the day,
  5756	Which streams too much on all, years, man, have reft away.
  5757	
  5758	CXLIV.
  5759	
  5760	   But when the rising moon begins to climb
  5761	   Its topmost arch, and gently pauses there;
  5762	   When the stars twinkle through the loops of time,
  5763	   And the low night-breeze waves along the air,
  5764	   The garland-forest, which the grey walls wear,
  5765	   Like laurels on the bald first Caesar's head;
  5766	   When the light shines serene, but doth not glare,
  5767	   Then in this magic circle raise the dead:
  5768	Heroes have trod this spot--'tis on their dust ye tread.
  5769	
  5770	CXLV.
  5771	
  5772	   'While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand;
  5773	   When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;
  5774	   And when Rome falls--the World.'  From our own land
  5775	   Thus spake the pilgrims o'er this mighty wall
  5776	   In Saxon times, which we are wont to call
  5777	   Ancient; and these three mortal things are still
  5778	   On their foundations, and unaltered all;
  5779	   Rome and her Ruin past Redemption's skill,
  5780	The World, the same wide den--of thieves, or what ye will.
  5781	
  5782	CXLVI.
  5783	
  5784	   Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime--
  5785	   Shrine of all saints and temple of all gods,
  5786	   From Jove to Jesus--spared and blest by time;
  5787	   Looking tranquillity, while falls or nods
  5788	   Arch, empire, each thing round thee, and man plods
  5789	   His way through thorns to ashes--glorious dome!
  5790	   Shalt thou not last?--Time's scythe and tyrants' rods
  5791	   Shiver upon thee--sanctuary and home
  5792	Of art and piety--Pantheon!--pride of Rome!
  5793	
  5794	CXLVII.
  5795	
  5796	   Relic of nobler days, and noblest arts!
  5797	   Despoiled yet perfect, with thy circle spreads
  5798	   A holiness appealing to all hearts--
  5799	   To art a model; and to him who treads
  5800	   Rome for the sake of ages, Glory sheds
  5801	   Her light through thy sole aperture; to those
  5802	   Who worship, here are altars for their beads;
  5803	   And they who feel for genius may repose
  5804	Their eyes on honoured forms, whose busts around them close.
  5805	
  5806	CXLVIII.
  5807	
  5808	   There is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light
  5809	   What do I gaze on?  Nothing:  Look again!
  5810	   Two forms are slowly shadowed on my sight--
  5811	   Two insulated phantoms of the brain:
  5812	   It is not so:  I see them full and plain--
  5813	   An old man, and a female young and fair,
  5814	   Fresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein
  5815	   The blood is nectar:--but what doth she there,
  5816	With her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?
  5817	
  5818	CXLIX.
  5819	
  5820	   Full swells the deep pure fountain of young life,
  5821	   Where ON the heart and FROM the heart we took
  5822	   Our first and sweetest nurture, when the wife,
  5823	   Blest into mother, in the innocent look,
  5824	   Or even the piping cry of lips that brook
  5825	   No pain and small suspense, a joy perceives
  5826	   Man knows not, when from out its cradled nook
  5827	   She sees her little bud put forth its leaves--
  5828	What may the fruit be yet?--I know not--Cain was Eve's.
  5829	
  5830	CL.
  5831	
  5832	   But here youth offers to old age the food,
  5833	   The milk of his own gift:--it is her sire
  5834	   To whom she renders back the debt of blood
  5835	   Born with her birth.  No; he shall not expire
  5836	   While in those warm and lovely veins the fire
  5837	   Of health and holy feeling can provide
  5838	   Great Nature's Nile, whose deep stream rises higher
  5839	   Than Egypt's river:--from that gentle side
  5840	Drink, drink and live, old man! heaven's realm holds no such tide.
  5841	
  5842	CLI.
  5843	
  5844	   The starry fable of the milky way
  5845	   Has not thy story's purity; it is
  5846	   A constellation of a sweeter ray,
  5847	   And sacred Nature triumphs more in this
  5848	   Reverse of her decree, than in the abyss
  5849	   Where sparkle distant worlds:--Oh, holiest nurse!
  5850	   No drop of that clear stream its way shall miss
  5851	   To thy sire's heart, replenishing its source
  5852	With life, as our freed souls rejoin the universe.
  5853	
  5854	CLII.
  5855	
  5856	   Turn to the mole which Hadrian reared on high,
  5857	   Imperial mimic of old Egypt's piles,
  5858	   Colossal copyist of deformity,
  5859	   Whose travelled phantasy from the far Nile's
  5860	   Enormous model, doomed the artist's toils
  5861	   To build for giants, and for his vain earth,
  5862	   His shrunken ashes, raise this dome:  How smiles
  5863	   The gazer's eye with philosophic mirth,
  5864	To view the huge design which sprung from such a birth!
  5865	
  5866	CLIII.
  5867	
  5868	   But lo! the dome--the vast and wondrous dome,
  5869	   To which Diana's marvel was a cell--
  5870	   Christ's mighty shrine above his martyr's tomb!
  5871	   I have beheld the Ephesian's miracle--
  5872	   Its columns strew the wilderness, and dwell
  5873	   The hyaena and the jackal in their shade;
  5874	   I have beheld Sophia's bright roofs swell
  5875	   Their glittering mass i' the sun, and have surveyed
  5876	Its sanctuary the while the usurping Moslem prayed;
  5877	
  5878	CLIV.
  5879	
  5880	   But thou, of temples old, or altars new,
  5881	   Standest alone--with nothing like to thee--
  5882	   Worthiest of God, the holy and the true,
  5883	   Since Zion's desolation, when that he
  5884	   Forsook his former city, what could be,
  5885	   Of earthly structures, in his honour piled,
  5886	   Of a sublimer aspect?  Majesty,
  5887	   Power, Glory, Strength, and Beauty, all are aisled
  5888	In this eternal ark of worship undefiled.
  5889	
  5890	CLV.
  5891	
  5892	   Enter:  its grandeur overwhelms thee not;
  5893	   And why? it is not lessened; but thy mind,
  5894	   Expanded by the genius of the spot,
  5895	   Has grown colossal, and can only find
  5896	   A fit abode wherein appear enshrined
  5897	   Thy hopes of immortality; and thou
  5898	   Shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined,
  5899	   See thy God face to face, as thou dost now
  5900	His Holy of Holies, nor be blasted by his brow.
  5901	
  5902	CLVI.
  5903	
  5904	   Thou movest--but increasing with th' advance,
  5905	   Like climbing some great Alp, which still doth rise,
  5906	   Deceived by its gigantic elegance;
  5907	   Vastness which grows--but grows to harmonise--
  5908	   All musical in its immensities;
  5909	   Rich marbles--richer painting--shrines where flame
  5910	   The lamps of gold--and haughty dome which vies
  5911	   In air with Earth's chief structures, though their frame
  5912	Sits on the firm-set ground--and this the clouds must claim.
  5913	
  5914	CLVII.
  5915	
  5916	   Thou seest not all; but piecemeal thou must break
  5917	   To separate contemplation, the great whole;
  5918	   And as the ocean many bays will make,
  5919	   That ask the eye--so here condense thy soul
  5920	   To more immediate objects, and control
  5921	   Thy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart
  5922	   Its eloquent proportions, and unroll
  5923	   In mighty graduations, part by part,
  5924	The glory which at once upon thee did not dart.
  5925	
  5926	CLVIII.
  5927	
  5928	   Not by its fault--but thine:  Our outward sense
  5929	   Is but of gradual grasp--and as it is
  5930	   That what we have of feeling most intense
  5931	   Outstrips our faint expression; e'en so this
  5932	   Outshining and o'erwhelming edifice
  5933	   Fools our fond gaze, and greatest of the great
  5934	   Defies at first our nature's littleness,
  5935	   Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate
  5936	Our spirits to the size of that they contemplate.
  5937	
  5938	CLIX.
  5939	
  5940	   Then pause and be enlightened; there is more
  5941	   In such a survey than the sating gaze
  5942	   Of wonder pleased, or awe which would adore
  5943	   The worship of the place, or the mere praise
  5944	   Of art and its great masters, who could raise
  5945	   What former time, nor skill, nor thought could plan;
  5946	   The fountain of sublimity displays
  5947	   Its depth, and thence may draw the mind of man
  5948	Its golden sands, and learn what great conceptions can.
  5949	
  5950	CLX.
  5951	
  5952	   Or, turning to the Vatican, go see
  5953	   Laocoon's torture dignifying pain--
  5954	   A father's love and mortal's agony
  5955	   With an immortal's patience blending:--Vain
  5956	   The struggle; vain, against the coiling strain
  5957	   And gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,
  5958	   The old man's clench; the long envenomed chain
  5959	   Rivets the living links,--the enormous asp
  5960	Enforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp.
  5961	
  5962	CLXI.
  5963	
  5964	   Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,
  5965	   The God of life, and poesy, and light--
  5966	   The Sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow
  5967	   All radiant from his triumph in the fight;
  5968	   The shaft hath just been shot--the arrow bright
  5969	   With an immortal's vengeance; in his eye
  5970	   And nostril beautiful disdain, and might
  5971	   And majesty, flash their full lightnings by,
  5972	Developing in that one glance the Deity.
  5973	
  5974	CLXII.
  5975	
  5976	   But in his delicate form--a dream of Love,
  5977	   Shaped by some solitary nymph, whose breast
  5978	   Longed for a deathless lover from above,
  5979	   And maddened in that vision--are expressed
  5980	   All that ideal beauty ever blessed
  5981	   The mind within its most unearthly mood,
  5982	   When each conception was a heavenly guest--
  5983	   A ray of immortality--and stood
  5984	Starlike, around, until they gathered to a god?
  5985	
  5986	CLXIII.
  5987	
  5988	   And if it be Prometheus stole from heaven
  5989	   The fire which we endure, it was repaid
  5990	   By him to whom the energy was given
  5991	   Which this poetic marble hath arrayed
  5992	   With an eternal glory--which, if made
  5993	   By human hands, is not of human thought
  5994	   And Time himself hath hallowed it, nor laid
  5995	   One ringlet in the dust--nor hath it caught
  5996	A tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought.
  5997	
  5998	CLXIV.
  5999	
  6000	   But where is he, the pilgrim of my song,
  6001	   The being who upheld it through the past?
  6002	   Methinks he cometh late and tarries long.
  6003	   He is no more--these breathings are his last;
  6004	   His wanderings done, his visions ebbing fast,
  6005	   And he himself as nothing:--if he was
  6006	   Aught but a phantasy, and could be classed
  6007	   With forms which live and suffer--let that pass--
  6008	His shadow fades away into Destruction's mass,
  6009	
  6010	CLXV.
  6011	
  6012	   Which gathers shadow, substance, life, and all
  6013	   That we inherit in its mortal shroud,
  6014	   And spreads the dim and universal pall
  6015	   Thro' which all things grow phantoms; and the cloud
  6016	   Between us sinks and all which ever glowed,
  6017	   Till Glory's self is twilight, and displays
  6018	   A melancholy halo scarce allowed
  6019	   To hover on the verge of darkness; rays
  6020	Sadder than saddest night, for they distract the gaze,
  6021	
  6022	CLXVI.
  6023	
  6024	   And send us prying into the abyss,
  6025	   To gather what we shall be when the frame
  6026	   Shall be resolved to something less than this
  6027	   Its wretched essence; and to dream of fame,
  6028	   And wipe the dust from off the idle name
  6029	   We never more shall hear,--but never more,
  6030	   Oh, happier thought! can we be made the same:
  6031	   It is enough, in sooth, that ONCE we bore
  6032	These fardels of the heart--the heart whose sweat was gore.
  6033	
  6034	CLXVII.
  6035	
  6036	   Hark! forth from the abyss a voice proceeds,
  6037	   A long, low distant murmur of dread sound,
  6038	   Such as arises when a nation bleeds
  6039	   With some deep and immedicable wound;
  6040	   Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground.
  6041	   The gulf is thick with phantoms, but the chief
  6042	   Seems royal still, though with her head discrowned,
  6043	   And pale, but lovely, with maternal grief
  6044	She clasps a babe, to whom her breast yields no relief.
  6045	
  6046	CLXVIII.
  6047	
  6048	   Scion of chiefs and monarchs, where art thou?
  6049	   Fond hope of many nations, art thou dead?
  6050	   Could not the grave forget thee, and lay low
  6051	   Some less majestic, less beloved head?
  6052	   In the sad midnight, while thy heart still bled,
  6053	   The mother of a moment, o'er thy boy,
  6054	   Death hushed that pang for ever:  with thee fled
  6055	   The present happiness and promised joy
  6056	Which filled the imperial isles so full it seemed to cloy.
  6057	
  6058	CLXIX.
  6059	
  6060	   Peasants bring forth in safety.--Can it be,
  6061	   O thou that wert so happy, so adored!
  6062	   Those who weep not for kings shall weep for thee,
  6063	   And Freedom's heart, grown heavy, cease to hoard
  6064	   Her many griefs for One; for she had poured
  6065	   Her orisons for thee, and o'er thy head
  6066	   Beheld her Iris.--Thou, too, lonely lord,
  6067	   And desolate consort--vainly wert thou wed!
  6068	The husband of a year! the father of the dead!
  6069	
  6070	CLXX.
  6071	
  6072	   Of sackcloth was thy wedding garment made:
  6073	   Thy bridal's fruit is ashes; in the dust
  6074	   The fair-haired Daughter of the Isles is laid,
  6075	   The love of millions!  How we did entrust
  6076	   Futurity to her! and, though it must
  6077	   Darken above our bones, yet fondly deemed
  6078	   Our children should obey her child, and blessed
  6079	   Her and her hoped-for seed, whose promise seemed
  6080	Like star to shepherd's eyes; 'twas but a meteor beamed.
  6081	
  6082	CLXXI.
  6083	
  6084	   Woe unto us, not her; for she sleeps well:
  6085	   The fickle reek of popular breath, the tongue
  6086	   Of hollow counsel, the false oracle,
  6087	   Which from the birth of monarchy hath rung
  6088	   Its knell in princely ears, till the o'erstrung
  6089	   Nations have armed in madness, the strange fate
  6090	   Which tumbles mightiest sovereigns, and hath flung
  6091	   Against their blind omnipotence a weight
  6092	Within the opposing scale, which crushes soon or late,--
  6093	
  6094	CLXXII.
  6095	
  6096	   These might have been her destiny; but no,
  6097	   Our hearts deny it:  and so young, so fair,
  6098	   Good without effort, great without a foe;
  6099	   But now a bride and mother--and now THERE!
  6100	   How many ties did that stern moment tear!
  6101	   From thy Sire's to his humblest subject's breast
  6102	   Is linked the electric chain of that despair,
  6103	   Whose shock was as an earthquake's, and oppressed
  6104	The land which loved thee so, that none could love thee best.
  6105	
  6106	CLXXIII.
  6107	
  6108	   Lo, Nemi! navelled in the woody hills
  6109	   So far, that the uprooting wind which tears
  6110	   The oak from his foundation, and which spills
  6111	   The ocean o'er its boundary, and bears
  6112	   Its foam against the skies, reluctant spares
  6113	   The oval mirror of thy glassy lake;
  6114	   And, calm as cherished hate, its surface wears
  6115	   A deep cold settled aspect nought can shake,
  6116	All coiled into itself and round, as sleeps the snake.
  6117	
  6118	CLXXIV.
  6119	
  6120	   And near Albano's scarce divided waves
  6121	   Shine from a sister valley;--and afar
  6122	   The Tiber winds, and the broad ocean laves
  6123	   The Latian coast where sprung the Epic war,
  6124	   'Arms and the Man,' whose reascending star
  6125	   Rose o'er an empire,--but beneath thy right
  6126	   Tully reposed from Rome;--and where yon bar
  6127	   Of girdling mountains intercepts the sight,
  6128	The Sabine farm was tilled, the weary bard's delight.
  6129	
  6130	CLXXV.
  6131	
  6132	   But I forget.--My pilgrim's shrine is won,
  6133	   And he and I must part,--so let it be,--
  6134	   His task and mine alike are nearly done;
  6135	   Yet once more let us look upon the sea:
  6136	   The midland ocean breaks on him and me,
  6137	   And from the Alban mount we now behold
  6138	   Our friend of youth, that ocean, which when we
  6139	   Beheld it last by Calpe's rock unfold
  6140	Those waves, we followed on till the dark Euxine rolled
  6141	
  6142	CLXXVI.
  6143	
  6144	   Upon the blue Symplegades:  long years--
  6145	   Long, though not very many--since have done
  6146	   Their work on both; some suffering and some tears
  6147	   Have left us nearly where we had begun:
  6148	   Yet not in vain our mortal race hath run,
  6149	   We have had our reward--and it is here;
  6150	   That we can yet feel gladdened by the sun,
  6151	   And reap from earth, sea, joy almost as dear
  6152	As if there were no man to trouble what is clear.
  6153	
  6154	CLXXVII.
  6155	
  6156	   Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place,
  6157	   With one fair Spirit for my minister,
  6158	   That I might all forget the human race,
  6159	   And, hating no one, love but only her!
  6160	   Ye Elements!--in whose ennobling stir
  6161	   I feel myself exalted--can ye not
  6162	   Accord me such a being?  Do I err
  6163	   In deeming such inhabit many a spot?
  6164	Though with them to converse can rarely be our lot.
  6165	
  6166	CLXXVIII.
  6167	
  6168	   There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
  6169	   There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
  6170	   There is society where none intrudes,
  6171	   By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
  6172	   I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
  6173	   From these our interviews, in which I steal
  6174	   From all I may be, or have been before,
  6175	   To mingle with the Universe, and feel
  6176	What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
  6177	
  6178	CLXXIX.
  6179	
  6180	   Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!
  6181	   Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
  6182	   Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
  6183	   Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
  6184	   The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
  6185	   A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
  6186	   When for a moment, like a drop of rain,
  6187	   He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
  6188	Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.
  6189	
  6190	CLXXX.
  6191	
  6192	   His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields
  6193	   Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise
  6194	   And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
  6195	   For earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
  6196	   Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,
  6197	   And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
  6198	   And howling, to his gods, where haply lies
  6199	   His petty hope in some near port or bay,
  6200	And dashest him again to earth:--there let him lay.
  6201	
  6202	CLXXXI.
  6203	
  6204	   The armaments which thunderstrike the walls
  6205	   Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,
  6206	   And monarchs tremble in their capitals.
  6207	   The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs make
  6208	   Their clay creator the vain title take
  6209	   Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war;
  6210	   These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,
  6211	   They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar
  6212	Alike the Armada's pride, or spoils of Trafalgar.
  6213	
  6214	CLXXXII.
  6215	
  6216	   Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee--
  6217	   Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?
  6218	   Thy waters washed them power while they were free
  6219	   And many a tyrant since:  their shores obey
  6220	   The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay
  6221	   Has dried up realms to deserts:  not so thou,
  6222	   Unchangeable save to thy wild waves' play--
  6223	   Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow--
  6224	Such as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.
  6225	
  6226	CLXXXIII.
  6227	
  6228	   Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form
  6229	   Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,
  6230	   Calm or convulsed--in breeze, or gale, or storm,
  6231	   Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime
  6232	   Dark-heaving;--boundless, endless, and sublime--
  6233	   The image of Eternity--the throne
  6234	   Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime
  6235	   The monsters of the deep are made; each zone
  6236	Obeys thee:  thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.
  6237	
  6238	CLXXXIV.
  6239	
  6240	   And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy
  6241	   Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
  6242	   Borne like thy bubbles, onward:  from a boy
  6243	   I wantoned with thy breakers--they to me
  6244	   Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
  6245	   Made them a terror--'twas a pleasing fear,
  6246	   For I was as it were a child of thee,
  6247	   And trusted to thy billows far and near,
  6248	And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.
  6249	
  6250	CLXXXV.
  6251	
  6252	   My task is done--my song hath ceased--my theme
  6253	   Has died into an echo; it is fit
  6254	   The spell should break of this protracted dream.
  6255	   The torch shall be extinguished which hath lit
  6256	   My midnight lamp--and what is writ, is writ--
  6257	   Would it were worthier! but I am not now
  6258	   That which I have been--and my visions flit
  6259	   Less palpably before me--and the glow
  6260	Which in my spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low.
  6261	
  6262	CLXXXVI.
  6263	
  6264	   Farewell! a word that must be, and hath been--
  6265	   A sound which makes us linger; yet, farewell!
  6266	   Ye, who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene
  6267	   Which is his last, if in your memories dwell
  6268	   A thought which once was his, if on ye swell
  6269	   A single recollection, not in vain
  6270	   He wore his sandal-shoon and scallop shell;
  6271	   Farewell! with HIM alone may rest the pain,
  6272	If such there were--with YOU, the moral of his strain.
  6273
